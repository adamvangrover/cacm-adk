# META Comprehensive Analysis Workflow Output (SK Press Release Integration v1)

This package contains the outputs from the Meta Platforms, Inc. (META) comprehensive analysis workflow, executed on `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS UTC` (placeholder for actual execution timestamp).

This version of the workflow features the integration of Semantic Kernel (SK) for processing and summarizing financial press releases. The insights and summaries generated by SK from these documents are incorporated into the outputs of the `FundamentalAnalystAgent` and `SNCAnalystAgent`, and are reflected in the final human-readable Markdown report.

## Key Features in this Output:

*   **SK-Enhanced Analysis:** Both the `FundamentalAnalystAgent` and `SNCAnalystAgent` now leverage SK to summarize key information from provided press releases (`META_press_release_2024_Q4_FY.txt` and `META_press_release_2025_Q1.txt`).
*   **Updated Reporting:** The final Markdown report (`generated_report_*.md`) includes new sections that explicitly display these SK-generated summaries and notes that the main analytical texts from these agents also incorporate these insights.
*   **Machine-Readable Outputs:** The raw JSON outputs from the analysis agents (`raw_fundamental_analysis.json`, `raw_snc_analysis.json`) now contain new fields holding the SK-generated summaries (e.g., `press_release_summaries` in FAA output, `sk_generated_press_release_insights` in SNCAA output).

## Crucial Known Limitation: Placeholder Summaries

**Due to the use of a dummy/non-functional API key for the underlying LLM service (e.g., OpenAI) during this specific execution, all Semantic Kernel skills that require an LLM have produced *placeholder* summaries.** 

Examples of placeholder text you will find:
*   `[Placeholder LLM Summary: Content would be generated here based on provided input.]`
*   `Summary could not be generated by SK (placeholder returned).`

With a valid and configured API key, these sections would contain actual LLM-generated textual summaries derived from the press release content. The current output demonstrates the structural integration and data flow of SK-generated content, but not the qualitative output of the LLM.

## Other Known Limitations:

*   **Agent-Specific SK Skills:** Some agents, like `FundamentalAnalystAgent` (for its main `analysis_summary`) and `SNCAnalystAgent` (for detailed SNC criteria assessment like `CollateralRiskAssessment`), attempt to use their own specialized Semantic Kernel skills (e.g., `FundamentalAnalysisSkill.SummarizeAnalysis`, various skills in `SNCRatingAssistSkill`). These skills are currently not fully implemented or correctly registered within their respective plugins, leading to fallback logic or "Skill not found" errors for those specific internal agent tasks. This is separate from the successful integration of the shared `SummarizationSkills.summarize_section` for press releases.
*   **Catalyst Agent Connectivity:** The `CatalystWrapperAgent` continues to experience connection errors to its dependent microservices (e.g., `localhost:8001`, `localhost:8002`, etc.), resulting in minimal output from this agent. This is a known issue related to the external service dependencies not being available in the execution environment.

## Source Workflow:

The analysis was generated using the workflow definition: `examples/meta_comprehensive_analysis_workflow.json`.

## Contents:

*   `generated_report_*.md`: The final human-readable report in Markdown format.
*   `raw_fundamental_analysis.json`: Raw JSON output from the `FundamentalAnalystAgent`.
*   `raw_snc_analysis.json`: Raw JSON output from the `SNCAnalystAgent`.
*   `raw_catalyst_output.json`: Raw JSON output from the `CatalystWrapperAgent`.
*   `README.md`: This file.

Please review the contents bearing in mind the placeholder nature of the SK-generated text.
