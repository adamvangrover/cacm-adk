# Analysis Output Package for META Comprehensive Workflow

This package contains the outputs from a run of the `examples/meta_comprehensive_analysis_workflow.json` workflow.

## Contents:

1.  **Human-Readable Report:**
    *   `generated_report_8bf6b2d1-09c5-44df-bec9-b0db73ab25d4_meta_comprehensive_analysis_001.md`: This Markdown file is the main consolidated report generated by the `ReportGenerationAgent`.

2.  **Raw Agent Outputs (Machine Files):**
    *   `raw_fundamental_analysis.json`: Contains the raw JSON output from the `FundamentalAnalystAgent`.
    *   `raw_snc_analysis.json`: Contains the raw JSON output from the `SNCAnalystAgent`.
    *   `raw_catalyst_output.json`: Contains the raw JSON output from the `CatalystWrapperAgent`.

## Important Notes on Data Content:

The data within both the human-readable report and the raw JSON files may include mock data, fallback values, or error indicators. This is due to several factors observed during the execution run:

*   **Semantic Kernel Native Skill Issue:** An error (`module 'semantic_kernel' has no attribute 'kernel_function'`) occurred during Semantic Kernel initialization. This prevented native skills from being correctly registered and used by agents like `FundamentalAnalystAgent` and `SNCAnalystAgent`, leading them to use fallback logic for summaries and assessments.
*   **Catalyst Agent Dependencies:** The `CatalystWrapperAgent` could not connect to its dependent microservices (which were not active during the run), resulting in it returning a default "No opportunities identified" message.
*   **Data Retrieval for 'META':** The `DataRetrievalAgent` used generic placeholder data for the company ID 'META', as specific mock data for this entity was not configured for all required fields. This affects the depth and accuracy of the analyses performed by downstream agents.

Therefore, while the workflow structure and inter-agent data flow have been verified, the analytical content itself is based on these limitations.
