    <h3>Corporate Credit Rating Report: DoorDash, Inc. (DASH) - Balanced M&A Scenario</h3>
    <p><strong>Report Date:</strong> April 27, 2025 (Simulated)</p>
    <p><strong>Simulated Internal Rating:</strong> BB+ / Stable</p>
    <p><strong>Key Event:</strong> Potential Deliveroo acquisition (~$3.6B), assumed funded via ~$1.6B cash & ~$2.0B new debt.</p>
    <h4>Executive Summary:</h4>
    <p>DoorDash's FY 2024 positive Net Income and $1.8B FCF provide a strong base. The Deliveroo acquisition, funded with cash and new debt, introduces moderate leverage (Debt/Equity ~26%) but is initially manageable. The profile (BB+/Ba1 simulated) balances this improved baseline against M&A execution risks and ongoing headwinds (competition, regulatory). Stable outlook reflects these offsetting factors.</p>
    <h4>Key Credit Factors:</h4>
    <p><strong>Strengths:</strong> Strong FY24 performance (NI positive, $1.8B FCF), market leadership, solid revenue growth, strong pre-deal balance sheet, high EV.</p>
    <p><strong>Challenges/Risks:</strong> Deliveroo M&A uncertainty (completion, integration, synergies), increased pro-forma leverage, intense competition, global regulatory uncertainty (gig worker), macroeconomic sensitivity.</p>
    <h4>Financial Profile (Post-Assumed M&A):</h4>
    <p>Leverage increases (Debt/Adj. EBITDA ~1.1x). New interest expense will impact coverage. FCF, while strong, will be affected by interest and integration costs before synergies. Liquidity remains strong.</p>
    <h4>Outlook & Uncertainties:</h4>
    <p>Stable outlook balances current strength with M&A execution risks. Key uncertainties: deal completion, synergy realization, leverage management, gig worker regulations, competition, consumer spending.</p>
