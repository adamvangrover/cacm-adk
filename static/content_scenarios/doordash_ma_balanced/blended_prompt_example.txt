Please initiate a credit analysis for DoorDash (DASH), assuming the potential Deliveroo acquisition (~$3.6B) is funded via a balanced mix of existing cash (~$1.6B) and new debt (~$2.0B). Focus on profitability sustainability, FCF generation, leverage management, M&A integration execution, and competitive positioning over a 1-3 year horizon. Incorporate FY 2024 10-K results and the Deliveroo announcement. Assess risk appetite based on 'Framework A', considering market volatility, regulatory landscape, M&A financial impact, and synergy realization.

I need access to vectorized summaries for their Q3 2024 earnings call (though FY24 10-K supersedes parts of this) and recent news articles regarding competitive pressures and regulatory developments.

Use this conceptual configuration:

After running the core analysis, let's brainstorm the potential impact of rising interest rates on their cash flow and path to profitability given the new debt. Synthesize everything into a single JSON-LD output file suitable as an MVP report. Include the rating, risk score, key findings, uncertainties, and our brainstorming discussion points.
