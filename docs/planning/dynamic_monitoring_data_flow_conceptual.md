# Dynamic Monitoring & Data Flow: Conceptual Design

## A. Introduction/Vision

The primary vision is to establish a dynamic and continuously updated understanding of credit risk. This moves beyond static, point-in-time assessments by actively monitoring a varietys of relevant data points and events. The ultimate aim is to feed this information into a system that supports a "dynamic probability map" or a "continuous risk profile assessment" for entities of interest (e.g., obligors, financial instruments). This allows for proactive risk management, early warning signal detection, and more timely interventions.

## B. Key Data Sources & Monitoring CACMs

The system will leverage several specialized Credit Analysis Capability Modules (CACMs) designed for monitoring specific types of information. Recently defined relevant CACM templates include:

1.  **`News_Sentiment_Analysis_Template` (`urn:adk:template:monitoring:news_sentiment_analysis:v1`)**:
    *   **Information Feed:** This CACM processes news articles (from URLs or queries) related to specific entities or topics. It outputs overall sentiment scores, sentiment trends (improving, deteriorating, stable), key positive/negative themes identified in the news, and details of analyzed articles. This provides qualitative insights into public perception and emerging narratives.

2.  **`Market_Data_Change_Monitor_Template` (`urn:adk:template:monitoring:market_data_change_monitor:v1`)**:
    *   **Information Feed:** This CACM monitors specified market data series (e.g., stock prices, credit default swap spreads, commodity prices) against predefined thresholds or significant percentage changes. It generates alerts when these conditions are met, providing quantitative signals of market volatility or specific price movements relevant to an entity's risk.

3.  **`Trigger_Event_Definition_Template` (`urn:adk:template:monitoring:trigger_event_definition:v1`)**:
    *   **Information Feed:** Unlike the others, this template doesn't actively fetch data. Instead, it *defines* the conditions under which a significant "trigger event" should be recognized. These definitions specify data points to watch (potentially from other CACMs' outputs or direct KG data), comparison operators, and threshold values. Its output is a structured definition of a trigger that other components (like an orchestrator) will use.

## C. Information Flow & Processing

1.  **Data Ingestion:** Raw data (news feeds, market data streams, internal system updates) is acquired by the relevant monitoring CACMs.
2.  **CACM Execution:** These CACMs process their respective inputs.
    *   `News_Sentiment_Analysis` would generate sentiment scores and themes.
    *   `Market_Data_Change_Monitor` would identify threshold breaches or significant shifts in market values.
3.  **Event/Alert Generation:**
    *   The outputs of these monitoring CACMs can be translated into instances within our Knowledge Graph. For example:
        *   A significant finding from the `News_Sentiment_Analysis` (e.g., a sharp deterioration in sentiment) could generate an instance of `kgclass:Event` (e.g., a `CompanyNewsEvent`) and potentially a `kgclass:MonitoringAlert`.
        *   An alert from the `Market_Data_Change_Monitor` would directly instantiate a `kgclass:MonitoringAlert`. This alert would detail the series, the breach, and current values.
    *   These new instances would be populated with relevant data, such as `kgprop:hasSeverity`, `kgprop:occurredAtTime`, and linked to the entity in question (e.g., `kgclass:Obligor`) via `kgprop:pertainsTo`. The `kgprop:isTriggeredBy` property on the alert could link to the specific data point or event that caused it.
4.  **Time-Series Data Handling:**
    *   For continuous data like market prices, individual readings could be stored as instances of `kgclass:TimeSeriesDataPoint`. Each instance would have a `kgprop:hasValueNumeric` (or `kgprop:hasValue` for non-numeric series), `kgprop:occurredAtTime`, and `kgprop:belongsToSeries` (linking to a conceptual representation of the specific time series, e.g., "AAPL_Stock_Price"). This allows for historical tracking and trend analysis.

## D. Role of a "Monitoring Orchestrator" CACM (Conceptual)

A higher-level "Monitoring Orchestrator" CACM would be crucial for managing this ecosystem effectively. Its responsibilities would include:

1.  **Scheduling & Triggering:**
    *   Managing the execution schedule for data fetching and monitoring CACMs (e.g., run news analysis every hour, check market data every 15 minutes).
    *   Potentially triggering ad-hoc execution of certain CACMs based on incoming events or alerts.
2.  **Event/Alert Consumption:**
    *   Subscribing to or polling for new instances of `kgclass:Event` and `kgclass:MonitoringAlert` generated by the monitoring CACMs.
3.  **Trigger Evaluation:**
    *   Loading and interpreting `Trigger_Event_Definition_Template` instances.
    *   Continuously evaluating the conditions defined in these triggers against the incoming stream of data, events, and alerts.
4.  **Information Aggregation & Escalation:**
    *   If a defined trigger's conditions are met, the Orchestrator would generate a higher-level "composite event" or escalate the alert.
    *   Aggregating multiple related low-level alerts into a more significant, consolidated insight.
    *   Updating a central risk profile or dashboard.

## E. Updating the "Dynamic Risk Profile" / "Probability Map"

The processed information (events, alerts, new data points) directly contributes to a dynamic understanding of an obligor's risk profile. This can manifest in several ways:

1.  **Dynamic PD Score Updates:** Significant events (e.g., sustained negative sentiment, critical market threshold breach, activation of a high-severity trigger by the Orchestrator) could serve as inputs to models that dynamically adjust an obligor's Probability of Default (PD) or internal credit score.
2.  **Qualitative Risk Assessment Changes:** Persistent negative news themes, or newly identified risks from market data, could lead to updates in the qualitative aspects of a credit assessment (e.g., changing a "Management Stability" score from Positive to Neutral).
3.  **New Alert Generation for Review:** The Monitoring Orchestrator, upon evaluating complex trigger conditions, might generate new, higher-order alerts that specifically require human analyst review and intervention.
4.  **Dashboard / Health Status Updates:** Key risk indicators (KRIs), sentiment trends, market data trends, and active high-severity alerts can be visually represented on a dynamic dashboard, providing an at-a-glance "health status" for an obligor or portfolio.

## F. Knowledge Graph Integration

The Knowledge Graph (KG), defined by `credit_ontology.ttl` and populated with instances, is central to this dynamic system:

1.  **Data Hub:** The KG acts as a central repository for storing:
    *   Instances of `kgclass:Event`, `kgclass:MonitoringAlert`, `kgclass:TimeSeriesDataPoint`.
    *   Relationships between these instances and core entities like `kgclass:Obligor`, `kgclass:FinancialInstrument`, `kgclass:RiskFactor`.
    *   Definitions of triggers (instantiated from `Trigger_Event_Definition_Template`).
2.  **Context Provision:** When the Monitoring Orchestrator evaluates trigger conditions, it can query the KG to fetch relevant contextual information (e.g., existing risk factors for an obligor, their industry, related financial instruments).
3.  **Complex Queries & Reasoning:** The KG enables complex queries over time-varying data and interconnected events. For example:
    *   "Show all obligors in the 'Energy' sector with deteriorating news sentiment and a CDS spread increase of over 10% in the last week."
    *   "Identify if a `kgclass:Covenant` threshold is close to being breached based on latest `kgclass:TimeSeriesDataPoint` for relevant metrics."
    *   Potentially, OWL reasoning could infer new risks based on combined conditions.
4.  **Audit Trail & Lineage:** The KG can provide a clear audit trail of how data points, events, and alerts contributed to changes in a risk profile over time, by following relationships like `kgprop:isTriggeredBy` or `kgprop:isDerivedFrom`.
