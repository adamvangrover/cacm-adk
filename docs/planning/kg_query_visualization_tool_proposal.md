## Proposal for KG Query/Visualization Tools

Based on the requirements for lightweight, easy-to-use, open-source tools for local RDF file querying (SPARQL) and basic graph visualization, here are two recommendations catering to slightly different developer workflows:

**1. Python Ecosystem (`rdflib` + `pyvis`/`graphviz`)**

*   **Description:** This approach involves using Python libraries to programmatically load, query, and visualize RDF data.
    *   `rdflib`: A powerful Python library for working with RDF, allowing parsing of local files (TTL, RDF/XML, etc.), graph manipulation, and SPARQL querying.
    *   `pyvis`: A Python library for creating interactive network visualizations in HTML, which can be easily generated from `rdflib` graph data or query results.
    *   `graphviz` (Python bindings): Can be used to generate static graph diagrams (e.g., PNG, SVG) from RDF data, useful for specific query results or smaller graph snapshots.
*   **Pros:**
    *   **Highly Flexible:** Full programmatic control over data loading, querying, and the visualization process.
    *   **Easy Integration:** Seamlessly integrates into existing Python-based development workflows and data processing pipelines.
    *   **Lightweight Setup for Python Developers:** Requires simple `pip install` for libraries.
    *   **Good SPARQL Support:** `rdflib` provides robust SPARQL 1.1 query execution against the loaded graph.
    *   **Interactive Visualization:** `pyvis` enables interactive exploration of graphs (pan, zoom, node selection) in a web browser.
    *   **Static Visualizations:** `graphviz` is excellent for generating clean, publication-quality static graph diagrams.
    *   **Cross-Platform:** Python and these libraries are available on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
    *   **Works directly with local files.**
*   **Cons:**
    *   **Requires Coding:** Not a point-and-click GUI application. Users need to write Python scripts to perform actions.
    *   **Ad-hoc Exploration:** Quick, ad-hoc exploration might be slightly slower than a dedicated GUI tool if a script needs to be modified each time.

**2. RDF4J Workbench (with a Local Native Store)**

*   **Description:** RDF4J is an open-source Java framework for processing and storing RDF data. The RDF4J Workbench is a web application (can be run locally, e.g., via Docker or deploying the WAR file) that provides an interface for managing RDF4J repositories, executing SPARQL queries, and performing other RDF-related tasks. It can use a "Native Store" which is a persistent, file-based RDF repository.
*   **Pros:**
    *   **Full SPARQL Support:** Comprehensive SPARQL query editor and execution capabilities.
    *   **Works with Local Files:** Users can create a local "Native Store" repository and upload local RDF files (TTL, RDF/XML, etc.) into it.
    *   **GUI for Querying & Management:** Offers a web-based graphical user interface for repository management, querying, and viewing results, which is good for users who prefer a GUI over coding for some tasks.
    *   **Mature & Robust:** Part of a well-established and widely used RDF framework.
    *   **FOSS:** Eclipse Distribution License 2.0.
    *   **Cross-Platform:** Java-based, deployable on various operating systems.
    *   **Basic Visualization:** Query results can be viewed in tabular format. Graph results from CONSTRUCT queries can sometimes be visualized directly in simple forms or easily exported in RDF formats for other tools. The exploration is primarily query-driven.
*   **Cons:**
    *   **Slightly Heavier Setup:** Involves running a web application (though it can be local). Might feel less "lightweight" than a single executable or a Python script for some developers.
    *   **Visualization is Not the Primary Focus:** While functional for query results, the built-in graph visualization capabilities are not as advanced or interactive as dedicated graph visualization libraries/tools. The focus is more on data management and querying.
    *   **Indirect File Handling:** Files are loaded into a repository rather than being queried "in-place" directly from the file system in every session (though this also offers persistence and indexing benefits).
*   **Link:**
    *   RDF4J: [https://rdf4j.org/](https://rdf4j.org/)
    *   RDF4J Workbench Documentation: (Typically found within the main RDF4J documentation site, e.g., sections on server/workbench setup)

**Recommendation Rationale:**

*   The **Python ecosystem (`rdflib` + `pyvis`)** is recommended as the primary tool for developers within this project. It aligns well with the existing scripting approach, offers excellent control, and `pyvis` provides good enough interactive visualization for exploration of small to medium local graphs generated from our TTL files.
*   **RDF4J Workbench** is a good secondary option if a more persistent local store or a dedicated GUI for SPARQL querying is preferred by some users, with the understanding that its direct graph visualization is more basic.

These tools should provide sufficient capabilities for the team's current needs for querying and visualizing the knowledge graph from local TTL files.
