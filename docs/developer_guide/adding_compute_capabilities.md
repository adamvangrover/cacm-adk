# Adding Compute Capabilities

Compute capabilities refer to the underlying resources and environments where agents and their skills execute. This could range from local machine execution to distributed cloud functions or specialized hardware. This guide discusses considerations for adding or interfacing with new compute capabilities.

## Key Considerations

*   **Execution Environment:** Where will the code run? (e.g., local Python environment, Docker container, Kubernetes pod, serverless function, specialized hardware).
*   **Resource Requirements:** What are the CPU, memory, GPU (if any), and storage needs?
*   **Dependencies:** What libraries, frameworks, or external services are required? How will these be managed?
*   **Scalability:** Does the capability need to scale based on demand?
*   **Security:** What are the security implications? How will access and data be protected?
*   **Cost:** What are the cost implications of using this compute capability?
*   **Integration:** How will agents or the orchestrator invoke logic on this compute capability? (e.g., API calls, message queues, direct library usage).
*   **Monitoring & Logging:** How will processes running on this capability be monitored and logged?

## General Approaches

The specific steps to add a new compute capability will vary greatly depending on its nature. Below are some general approaches:

1.  **Local Execution (Default):**
    *   Many agents and skills may run directly within the main application's Python process.
    *   Ensure all dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt` or a similar dependency management file.
    *   This is the simplest model but may not be suitable for resource-intensive or highly specialized tasks.

2.  **Containerization (e.g., Docker):**
    *   **Purpose:** Package an agent, a skill, or a specific tool with its dependencies into a container for isolated and reproducible execution.
    *   **Steps:**
        *   Write a `Dockerfile` defining the environment.
        *   Build the Docker image.
        *   Run the container. Agents might interact with containerized services via network calls (e.g., REST API exposed by the container).
        *   Consider Docker Compose for managing multi-container applications locally.

3.  **Cloud-Based Compute (e.g., Serverless Functions, VMs, Kubernetes):**
    *   **Purpose:** Leverage cloud platforms for scalability, managed services, or specialized hardware (like GPUs).
    *   **Serverless Functions (e.g., AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, Google Cloud Functions):**
        *   Package a specific function or a small microservice.
        *   Define triggers (e.g., HTTP request, message queue event).
        *   The system would invoke these functions, often via HTTP APIs.
    *   **Virtual Machines (VMs) or Kubernetes:**
        *   Deploy more complex applications or services that require more control over the environment.
        *   May involve setting up infrastructure-as-code (e.g., Terraform, CloudFormation).
        *   Interactions would typically be via network APIs.

4.  **Specialized Hardware Integration:**
    *   **Purpose:** Utilize hardware like GPUs for machine learning, or other specialized processing units.
    *   **Steps:**
        *   Ensure drivers and necessary SDKs are installed in the execution environment.
        *   Modify agent/skill code to leverage the specific hardware APIs (e.g., CUDA for NVIDIA GPUs).
        *   This often involves careful environment configuration and may be best managed within containers or dedicated cloud instances.

## Integrating with Agents

Once a new compute capability is set up (e.g., a service running in a Docker container or a cloud function), agents need a way to interact with it.

*   **API Client:** If the capability exposes a REST or gRPC API, agents can use an HTTP client or a generated gRPC client to send requests and receive responses.
*   **Message Queues (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka, Redis Streams):** For asynchronous tasks, an agent might publish a message to a queue. A separate worker process, running on the new compute capability, would consume messages from the queue, perform the task, and potentially publish results to another queue.
*   **SDKs/Libraries:** If the compute capability is accessed via a specific SDK (e.g., `boto3` for AWS services), agents will use this SDK.

## Configuration and Management

*   **Configuration:** Endpoints, credentials, and other parameters for accessing new compute capabilities should be managed in configuration files and not hardcoded.
*   **Orchestration:** The Orchestrator might need to be aware of these capabilities, especially if it's responsible for deploying or scaling them (more advanced scenario).

## Documentation and Testing

*   **Documentation:** Clearly document how to set up, configure, and use the new compute capability. Include any specific prerequisites or deployment steps.
*   **Testing:**
    *   Test the functionality provided by the compute resource itself (e.g., unit/integration tests for a microservice).
    *   Test the integration between agents and the compute capability (e.g., can the agent successfully call the API and handle responses?).

This is a high-level overview. The specifics will depend heavily on the chosen technology and the project's architecture.
