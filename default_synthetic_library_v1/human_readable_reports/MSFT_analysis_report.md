Concerns: Minimal concerns regarding near-term repayment. SK Non-Accrual Assessment (Accrual Appropriate): The entity is highly profitable and meets all debt obligations; non-accrual status is not warranted.

### 5. Key Risk Factors (from Document)
Microsoft faces a variety of significant risks. Intense competition across all its markets, including from established and emerging technology companies, could adversely affect its business. Cybersecurity threats, data breaches, and disruptions to its cloud services (Azure) represent major operational risks. Evolving global regulations, particularly in areas of data privacy (like GDPR), antitrust, and AI ethics, could impose substantial compliance costs and impact business models. Changes in macroeconomic conditions, such as recessions, inflation, or fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates, may reduce IT spending and demand for Microsoft's products. The company's ability to innovate and adapt to rapidly changing technologies, such as the ongoing developments in AI, is critical to its continued success. Dependence on key personnel and the ability to attract and retain talent are also important risk factors.
