Leveraged Lending: A Comprehensive Legal Knowledge Base
I. Introduction to Leveraged Lending: A Legal Framework
Leveraged lending, a critical component of modern corporate finance, involves the extension of credit to companies or individuals already burdened with significant debt or possessing sub-investment grade credit ratings.1 This financial instrument is characterized by its inherent risk, a factor that profoundly influences the legal architecture of these transactions, dictating terms, documentation, and the relationship between borrowers and lenders. The market for leveraged loans has witnessed substantial growth, particularly in the United States where it has surpassed the $1 trillion mark, underscoring its economic significance and the concomitant need for robust legal and regulatory oversight.3
A. Defining Leveraged Lending: Key Characteristics and Market Overview
The core characteristic of a leveraged loan is the borrower's existing high leverage or impaired creditworthiness, leading lenders to demand higher compensation for the increased risk of default.1 Consequently, these loans typically carry higher interest rates than conventional credit facilities. Leveraged loans are frequently structured, arranged, and administered by one or more commercial or investment banks, known as "arrangers," who then often syndicate the loan to a broader group of banks and institutional investors. This syndication process serves to distribute risk among a larger pool of capital providers.1
A key feature of leveraged loans is the security package, which usually involves a pledge of the borrower's assets to collateralize the debt, providing lenders with a priority claim in the event of insolvency.1 Pricing is commonly based on a floating interest rate, historically tied to benchmarks like LIBOR, and more recently to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), plus a specified credit spread or margin.1 The transition from LIBOR to SOFR has introduced new layers of legal and operational complexity that must be addressed in credit documentation.
It is noteworthy that there is no universally accepted legal definition of a "leveraged loan." Market participants and credit rating agencies such as Moody's (which defines leveraged debt as rated Ba3 or lower) or S&P Global Ratings (which categorizes leveraged loans as those rated BB- or lower) employ varying criteria, including credit ratings or the spread of the interest rate over a benchmark.1 This definitional ambiguity can lead to inconsistencies in regulatory treatment and risk assessment across different institutions and jurisdictions. Such inconsistencies may create opportunities for regulatory arbitrage or result in supervisory gaps, potentially heightening systemic risk if highly leveraged transactions fall outside certain definitional parameters used by regulators. This also complicates cross-border comparisons and the uniform application of international financial standards.
Leveraged loans are predominantly utilized to finance leveraged buyouts (LBOs), mergers and acquisitions (M&A), corporate recapitalizations (including dividend recapitalizations where the company borrows to pay dividends to shareholders), and the refinancing of existing indebtedness.3 The specific purpose of the loan can significantly influence its legal structuring and the negotiation of its terms. The very nature of these purposes often entails a substantial increase in the borrower's risk profile post-transaction. This necessitates a forward-looking legal analysis during loan origination, focusing not just on the borrower's extant financial condition but critically on its pro forma leverage and the strategic, often aggressive, plans of its acquirers or sponsors.
The scale and characteristics of the leveraged lending market—particularly the combination of high risk and, at times, opacity—have led to concerns regarding its potential to contribute to systemic financial risk and to exacerbate economic downturns.3 While these concerns have prompted increased monitoring by financial regulators, the policy responses have largely remained limited.
A significant transformation in the leveraged loan market has been the shift in the lender base. While traditional banks remain involved, a substantial portion of leveraged loan capital is now provided by institutional investors, including collateralized loan obligations (CLOs), mutual funds, pension funds, insurance companies, and hedge funds.3 These non-bank entities often possess different investment horizons, risk appetites, and regulatory frameworks compared to traditional banking institutions. This evolution has altered negotiation dynamics, often leading to more borrower-friendly terms, such as "covenant-lite" structures, where traditional maintenance covenants are weakened or absent. This shift may also contribute to increased systemic risk if these non-bank lenders are subject to less stringent regulatory oversight, and the dispersion of risk occurs outside the full purview of traditional banking regulators.
B. Parties Involved and Their Legal Roles
A leveraged loan transaction involves a diverse set of participants, each with distinct legal roles and responsibilities:
Borrowers: These are typically corporations, often the targets of LBOs or acquisitions, or entities seeking to refinance existing debt or fund recapitalizations. They are characterized by substantial existing debt or credit ratings below investment grade.1 The borrower's primary legal obligations are to service the debt (make principal and interest payments as scheduled) and to comply with all terms and conditions stipulated in the credit agreement.
Lenders/Creditors: This group is increasingly diverse, encompassing traditional banks, insurance companies, pension funds, mutual funds, hedge funds, and specialized private investment funds, including direct lenders.2 Their fundamental legal right is to receive timely payment of principal and interest, and to exercise remedies contractually agreed upon in the event of a borrower default.
Arrangers (Mandated Lead Arrangers - MLAs): These are commercial or investment banks that take the lead in structuring, underwriting (committing to provide funds), and syndicating the loan.1 MLAs have significant legal responsibilities concerning the accuracy of the information memorandum distributed to potential syndicate lenders and the overall conduct of the syndication process.
Syndicate Lenders: These are the financial institutions and investment funds that acquire portions of the loan from the MLAs.1 Their rights and obligations are primarily governed by the credit agreement and any assignment or participation agreements through which they acquire their interest in the loan.
Facility Agent/Administrative Agent: Usually one of the lenders, the Facility Agent (in LMA terminology) or Administrative Agent (in US terminology) is responsible for the day-to-day administration of the loan. This includes managing communications between the borrower and the lender group, coordinating fund flows (drawdowns, interest and principal payments), monitoring covenant compliance, and processing waivers and amendments.6 The agent operates under legally defined duties outlined in the credit agreement and can face potential liabilities if these duties are breached.
Security Agent/Trustee: This entity, often also a financial institution, holds the security interests granted by the borrower and guarantors on behalf of the entire lender syndicate.6 Its primary role is to enforce the security upon instruction from the requisite lenders following an event of default. The Security Agent operates under a trust or agency framework, with specific fiduciary or contractual duties to the secured lenders. The multi-layered roles of financial institutions, which may simultaneously act as Arranger, Facility Agent, Security Agent, and a lender in the syndicate, can give rise to inherent conflicts of interest, especially in distressed scenarios. For instance, an agent's decision-making during a workout (e.g., regarding acceleration, waivers, or security enforcement) might be unduly influenced by its own economic exposure, potentially disadvantaging other syndicate lenders with differing interests. This necessitates meticulously drafted agency and intercreditor provisions that clearly delineate duties, exculpation clauses, and instruction mechanisms. The Stabilus case serves as a pertinent example of the complexities that can arise in this context.6
Private Equity Sponsors: In the context of LBOs, private equity firms are frequently the driving force behind the transaction. They contribute equity capital and exert significant influence over the negotiation of the loan terms, often resulting in documentation that is more favorable to the borrower.4 The relationship between the sponsor, the borrower (its portfolio company), and the lenders is a crucial dynamic throughout the life of the loan.
Legal Advisors: Law firms are indispensable to leveraged finance transactions, providing expert counsel to borrowers, sponsors, arrangers, and lenders. They are responsible for structuring the deal, drafting and negotiating the extensive legal documentation (including credit agreements, security documents, and intercreditor agreements), conducting due diligence, and navigating the complex legal and regulatory landscape.
Rating Agencies: Agencies like Moody's and S&P assess the creditworthiness of the borrower and the specific loan facility.1 While not direct parties to the loan agreement, their ratings significantly impact the loan's pricing, marketability to institutional investors, and overall investor appetite.
The increasing prominence of direct lenders 2 introduces a different dynamic compared to broadly syndicated loans. Direct lending transactions often involve a single lender or a small "club" of lenders, which can lead to more streamlined decision-making processes and more bespoke documentation. However, this concentration of lending power also means that borrowers may have less diverse creditor constituencies to negotiate with in times of stress, and risks are more concentrated with fewer parties.
C. The Legal Significance of High Leverage and Credit Risk
The defining characteristic of leveraged lending—high leverage and consequently elevated credit risk—is the cornerstone upon which the entire legal framework of these transactions is built.1 This heightened risk profile necessitates a departure from the documentation and terms typically found in investment-grade lending.
The increased probability of default means that lenders require more robust legal protections. This translates into comprehensive and meticulously drafted loan documentation, with particular emphasis on:
Covenants: These are contractual undertakings by the borrower to do certain things (affirmative covenants) or refrain from doing certain things (negative covenants), and to maintain certain financial metrics (financial covenants). In leveraged loans, covenants are generally more restrictive and detailed than in investment-grade facilities, providing lenders with mechanisms to monitor the borrower's performance and financial condition and to intervene if credit quality deteriorates.6
Events of Default: The credit agreement will specify a broad range of events that trigger a default, allowing lenders to accelerate the loan and exercise other remedies. These triggers are often more sensitive in leveraged loans to provide early warning signals.
Security Package: As previously mentioned, leveraged loans are typically secured. The negotiation and perfection of a comprehensive security package over the borrower's and guarantors' assets are paramount to protect lenders' interests and enhance their recovery prospects in an insolvency scenario.1
Lenders and their legal counsel must undertake extensive due diligence on the borrower's financial health, business operations, asset base (particularly for collateral valuation purposes 12), and existing legal and capital structure. Given that leveraged loans often finance acquisitions or LBOs where the target company's ability to generate sufficient cash flow to service the newly incurred debt is paramount 12, this due diligence extends to the viability of the post-transaction business model and the sponsor's projections. This focus on cash flow generation is reflected in specific financial covenants and detailed financial reporting requirements within the credit agreement.
The high leverage inherent in these transactions also means that borrowers have a reduced financial cushion to absorb economic shocks or operational setbacks. Consequently, the likelihood of financial distress is greater, making workouts, restructurings, and even formal insolvency proceedings more common than in the investment-grade sphere. These situations are often complex and can become highly contentious, placing significant strain on the original legal documentation and testing the robustness of the negotiated protections. The legal definitions of financial metrics, such as EBITDA, become critical battlegrounds in covenant negotiations. Sponsors often seek aggressive "add-backs" and adjustments to EBITDA, which can obscure the true financial performance of the borrower and delay the tripping of financial covenants, thereby undermining lender protections.6 The meticulous drafting and negotiation of these definitions are therefore essential legal exercises to ensure covenants provide meaningful and timely indicators of financial health.
II. The Leveraged Loan Credit Agreement: Anatomy and Key Legal Provisions (LMA Focus)
The credit agreement stands as the central legal document governing a leveraged loan. In the European market, and increasingly influencing global practice, the Loan Market Association (LMA) precedents play a significant role in shaping the structure and content of these agreements.
A. Overview of LMA Precedents and their Market Influence
The LMA was established to foster efficiency and standardization in the primary and secondary loan markets, partly by publishing recommended forms of loan agreements for various transaction types, including leveraged facilities.13 These documents, however, are explicitly non-binding and serve as a starting point for negotiation, requiring adaptation to the specific commercial terms and legal nuances of each deal.16
The LMA Leveraged Facilities Agreement, unlike its Investment Grade counterparts, was developed without the formal consultation of the Association of Corporate Treasurers (ACT), rendering it generally more lender-friendly in its initial form.16 Recognizing this, the ACT publishes its own borrower's guide to the LMA Leveraged Facilities Agreement, which highlights key negotiating issues from the borrower's perspective and serves as an important resource for corporate treasurers and their advisors.15
Despite their lender-oriented starting point, the widespread adoption of LMA forms has cultivated significant familiarity within the European investor community.13 However, a notable trend, especially in transactions backed by private equity sponsors, is the increasing incorporation of New York law-governed, high-yield bond-style covenant packages and definitions alongside traditional LMA boilerplate provisions.13 This convergence reflects the globalization of capital markets and the influence of U.S. private equity sponsors seeking more flexible, incurrence-based covenant structures, which differ significantly from the traditional LMA maintenance covenant approach.5 The legal implication is that European leveraged loans may retain the familiar LMA operational framework but embed a fundamentally different risk allocation and covenant protection scheme derived from U.S. high-yield practice.
LMA documentation is dynamic, evolving to reflect market developments, such as the transition from LIBOR to alternative reference rates 13, regulatory changes, and shifts in the negotiating leverage between borrowers and lenders, exemplified by the rise of covenant-lite structures.5 The very existence of the ACT's borrower-focused guide underscores the significant negotiation that invariably occurs, moving the "standard" LMA leveraged document towards a more bespoke agreement tailored to the specifics of the transaction and the prevailing market conditions.
B. Core Economic and Facility Terms
1. Loan Facility Types: Term Loan A, Term Loan B, Revolving Credit Facility – A Comparative Legal Analysis
Leveraged loan agreements typically comprise one or more distinct credit facilities, each with specific legal and economic characteristics tailored to different financing needs and investor appetites.4 The LMA provides template documentation for multicurrency term and revolving facilities, which are then adapted based on the commercial agreement.17
Term Loan A (TLA): Traditionally syndicated to commercial banks, TLAs are characterized by a scheduled amortization of principal over the life of the loan, which is typically shorter than that of a Term Loan B.4 TLAs often feature more stringent financial covenants, usually of the "maintenance" type, requiring regular compliance testing. These facilities are more common in less aggressively leveraged transactions or where relationship banking plays a significant role.
Term Loan B (TLB): Predominantly held by institutional investors such as CLOs, hedge funds, and other credit funds, TLBs typically feature minimal or no amortization (e.g., 1% per annum), with the bulk of the principal repaid as a "bullet" payment at maturity.4 Maturities for TLBs are commonly in the 5 to 7-year range. A defining feature of modern TLBs is the prevalence of "covenant-lite" or "covenant-loose" structures, which either lack traditional financial maintenance covenants entirely or include them only on a "springing" basis (e.g., tested only if a connected revolving facility is significantly drawn). This provides borrowers with greater operational flexibility but reduces lenders' early warning signals of financial deterioration. TLBs are the dominant instrument in LBOs and other large-scale leveraged financings. The bifurcation between TLA (bank-held, amortizing, maintenance covenants) and TLB (institutional-held, bullet repayment, incurrence/cov-lite covenants) reflects a clear segmentation of the lender market based on differing risk appetites, regulatory capital considerations, and investment strategies. This structural divergence has profound legal implications for covenant design, lender enforcement rights, and the trading liquidity of the respective loan tranches. The shift towards covenant-lite TLBs, driven by strong borrower and sponsor negotiating power in liquid market conditions, represents a significant recalibration of risk, granting borrowers enhanced operational freedom but potentially delaying the detection of financial distress and impacting lender recoveries in default scenarios.4
Revolving Credit Facility (RCF): An RCF provides a borrower with flexible access to funding up to a pre-set limit, allowing for funds to be drawn, repaid, and re-drawn as needed for working capital and general corporate purposes.4 RCFs are often secured alongside term loans and may include "springing" financial covenants that are tested only when drawings exceed a certain percentage of the total commitment (e.g., 30-40%).27 RCFs can be structured as cash flow-based facilities or as asset-based loans (ABLs), where the borrowing availability is tied to the value of specific current assets like receivables and inventory.4 Even within a predominantly covenant-lite TLB structure, RCFs often retain these springing maintenance covenants. This creates a "dual-track" covenant regime where RCF lenders (typically banks concerned about ongoing funding risk) possess stronger default triggers than institutional TLB lenders. Such a structure can lead to inter-lender conflicts if an RCF covenant is breached and RCF lenders wish to cease funding or accelerate, while TLB lenders, without a corresponding maintenance covenant breach, may lack immediate grounds for action.
Delayed Draw Term Loans (DDTLs): These are committed term loan facilities that are not funded at the initial closing but can be drawn by the borrower during a specified subsequent period, often to finance identified acquisitions, capital expenditures, or other specific projects.26 DDTLs typically rank pari passu with other existing term loan facilities in terms of security and repayment priority.
The choice and combination of these facility types are driven by the borrower's specific financing requirements, the nature of the transaction being financed (e.g., LBO, M&A, refinancing), and the prevailing conditions and risk appetite in the debt markets.
2. Loan Amount, Pricing, and Yield (including Original Issue Discount - OID)
The economic terms of a leveraged loan are critical and subject to intensive negotiation, reflecting the underlying credit risk and market dynamics.4
Loan Amount: The aggregate principal amount of the facilities is determined by the borrower's funding needs (e.g., acquisition price, refinancing amount), its capacity to service debt (leveraging ability), and lender appetite.
Pricing (Interest Rate): Leveraged loans almost invariably carry a floating interest rate, calculated as a benchmark rate (e.g., SOFR in the US, Euribor in Europe) plus a credit spread adjustment (CSA) or margin.1 The margin is a key component reflecting the lender's compensation for credit risk. "Margin ratchets" are common, allowing the margin to increase or decrease based on the borrower's performance against pre-agreed metrics, typically a leverage ratio.6 LMA documents often incorporate "LIBOR/Euribor floors," ensuring a minimum benchmark rate even if the underlying market rate falls below that floor.6
Fees: Borrowers typically pay various fees, including:
Arrangement Fees (or Upfront Fees): Paid to the arrangers for structuring and underwriting the loan.
Commitment Fees: Paid on the undrawn portion of a revolving credit facility.
Agency Fees: Paid to the facility agent and security agent for their ongoing administrative roles.6
Original Issue Discount (OID): This occurs when a loan or bond is issued at a price below its par or face value.30 The difference between the issue price and the par value constitutes the OID, which effectively increases the lender's yield.
Purpose: OID serves to enhance the attractiveness of a debt offering, particularly for higher-risk credits or in challenging market conditions where a higher effective yield is needed to clear the market without setting an unusually high stated coupon or margin.31 It can act as a "deal sweetener".31
Calculation: OID is the Redemption Price (par value at maturity) minus the Issuance Price.31 For example, a loan might be issued at 99% of par, meaning an OID of 1%.
Accounting and Tax Implications: For accounting and tax purposes, the OID is generally amortized over the term of the loan. For the lender, this amortized portion is treated as taxable interest income. For the borrower, it is an amortizable expense.31 This can lead to "phantom income" for bondholders, where tax is payable on accrued OID before it is received in cash at maturity.31 The OID is not merely a simple pricing adjustment but a strategic tool. Issuers might use it to manage overall funding costs, particularly in high prevailing interest rate environments where they prefer to offer a lower stated coupon, or to improve the marketability of debt for highly leveraged or complex credits. Legally, the credit agreement must clearly document how OID impacts yield-to-maturity calculations, tax reporting obligations for both parties, and calculations for prepayment amounts (which could be based on par value or the discounted issue price).
The combination of floating rates, credit spread margins, OID, and various fees creates a complex "all-in yield" for lenders and an "all-in cost" for borrowers. This total return or cost must be carefully analyzed from both legal and economic standpoints. Furthermore, as discussed next, market flex provisions can alter this yield profile after the initial mandate, making the pricing outlined in the term sheet indicative rather than definitively final.
3. Market Flex Provisions: Legal Mechanics and Implications
Market flex provisions are a standard feature in mandate letters or arrangement fee letters for syndicated leveraged loans. They grant arrangers and underwriters the contractual right to unilaterally alter certain terms of the financing after the mandate is signed but before final closing and syndication, if deemed necessary to ensure the successful sale of the debt to other investors.6 These provisions effectively shift syndication risk – the risk that market conditions may deteriorate or investor appetite may wane between mandate and syndication – from the arranging banks to the borrower.34
Location and Confidentiality: Market flex terms are typically detailed in confidential mandate letters or fee letters executed between the borrower and the arrangers, rather than in the main credit agreement that is circulated to the broader syndicate.35 This confidentiality is crucial because public knowledge of wide flex rights could incentivize potential syndicate lenders to hold back, anticipating more favorable terms if the initial syndication struggles. However, this opacity can also reduce market transparency regarding true initial pricing and terms.
Scope of Flex ("What can be flexed?"): The LMA standard wording generally contemplates changes to "pricing, terms and/or structure," often with an option to stipulate that the overall facility amount remains unchanged.35 The precise scope is a heavily negotiated point.
Pricing Flex: This is the most common form of flex and can involve adjustments to the interest margin, upfront fees, or OID. Pricing flex is often subject to an overall cap on the increase in the borrower's weighted average cost of capital. Invoking pricing flex may also necessitate a corresponding adjustment (reset) of financial covenant levels to maintain the originally agreed-upon headroom.35
Structural Flex: This allows arrangers to reallocate amounts between different tranches of a multi-tranche facility (e.g., shifting debt from a junior tranche to a senior tranche, or between term loan and bond tranches) to better align with investor demand, typically without altering the total quantum of debt.35
Terms Flex: Other non-economic terms of the credit agreement can also be subject to flex, such as the duration of prepayment penalties, the application of margin ratchets, the size of general debt or investment baskets, or even certain covenant definitions.35
Legal and Negotiation Dynamics:
The exercise of market flex must be legally binding, requiring obligors to execute amended facility documents reflecting the changes.35
Borrowers will seek to limit the scope of flex rights, often demanding consultation before flex is exercised, imposing caps on pricing adjustments, and sometimes negotiating a right to terminate the financing mandate if the flexed terms are unacceptable.34
An absolute "end date" or "sunset clause" for the exercise of flex rights is a critical protection for borrowers, preventing indefinite uncertainty.35
Market flex provisions represent a critical contractual allocation of syndication risk. Their broad potential scope can significantly alter the fundamental economics and legal obligations for the borrower compared to what was initially outlined in the term sheet. Consequently, the negotiation of the flex clause itself—particularly limitations on its use, borrower consultation rights, and potential termination rights—is a key legal battleground.
Reverse Flex and Market Conditions: In borrower-friendly market conditions characterized by high liquidity and strong investor demand, "reverse flex" provisions may be included.35 These allow for adjustments favorable to the borrower (e.g., a reduction in margin or fees) if the syndication is oversubscribed. Conversely, an increase in "lender flex," where lenders have more power to dictate terms during syndication, signals a shift towards a lender-friendly market, as noted in Q1 2025.36 The presence and nature of flex provisions thus serve as a barometer of prevailing market sentiment and the balance of negotiating power.
4. Maturity, Amortization, and Prepayment Rights (Mandatory and Voluntary, Call Protection)
The repayment profile of a leveraged loan, including its final maturity, interim amortization schedule, and provisions for early prepayment, are fundamental economic terms with significant legal implications.4
Maturity: Leveraged loans generally have shorter maturities compared to bonds.4 TLBs, for instance, commonly have maturities in the 5 to 7-year range.22
Amortization: This refers to the scheduled repayment of principal over the life of the loan.
Term Loan A (TLA): Typically features a full amortization schedule, meaning the principal is repaid in installments over the loan term.22
Term Loan B (TLB): Characterized by nominal amortization (e.g., 1% per annum, often paid quarterly) or, increasingly, no amortization, with the entire principal amount due as a single "bullet" repayment at maturity.4
Amortization Schedules: These detailed schedules outline the allocation of each periodic payment between principal and interest.41 It's important to distinguish between the loan term (the date the loan is legally due) and the amortization period (the timeframe over which payments are calculated); a mismatch can result in a significant balloon payment at the end of the loan term.41
Voluntary Prepayment: Borrowers in leveraged loan transactions generally have the right to prepay the loan in whole or in part at their option, often without incurring a significant penalty.4 However, "soft call" provisions have become increasingly common in the TLB market. These provisions impose a prepayment premium (e.g., 1-2% of the prepaid amount) if the loan is voluntarily prepaid or refinanced, particularly with lower-yielding debt, within a relatively short period after the closing date (typically 6 to 12 months).22 This is an attempt by institutional lenders to protect their expected yield against opportunistic refinancing by the borrower in a declining interest rate environment, though it is a weaker form of call protection than typically found in high-yield bonds, which often have "hard call" (non-callable for several years) or "make-whole" provisions.
Mandatory Prepayment (Cash Sweeps): Credit agreements, particularly those based on LMA precedents, traditionally include provisions requiring the borrower to make mandatory prepayments of the loan from certain cash inflows or upon the occurrence of specific events. The aim is to accelerate deleveraging when the borrower experiences a cash windfall or disposes of assets. Common mandatory prepayment triggers include 6:
Excess Cash Flow (ECF): A percentage of the borrower's ECF (a defined term typically representing cash flow after operating expenses, capital expenditures, taxes, and scheduled debt service) must be used to prepay the loan, often with the percentage varying based on the borrower's leverage ratio (a higher percentage sweep at higher leverage). These provisions are subject to negotiation regarding de minimis thresholds, permitted deductions (e.g., for voluntary prepayments, capital expenditures), and carry-forward amounts.6
Asset Disposals and Insurance/Condemnation Proceeds: Net proceeds from the sale of assets or the receipt of insurance or condemnation payments above certain thresholds are typically required to be applied to prepay the loan. However, these are often subject to significant "reinvestment rights," allowing the borrower to use such proceeds to acquire replacement assets, make capital expenditures, or otherwise reinvest in the business within a specified timeframe (e.g., 12-18 months). Increasingly, and reflecting borrower-friendly trends, these reinvestment rights have broadened, sometimes permitting proceeds to be used for acquisitions or even dividends, subject to certain conditions.6
Debt or Equity Issuances (including IPOs): Proceeds from the issuance of new debt (other than certain permitted debt) or equity (including an Initial Public Offering) may trigger a mandatory prepayment. These provisions are often subject to leverage-based step-downs (where the prepayment requirement reduces or falls away if leverage is below a certain level) or allow proceeds to be used for other permitted purposes.6
Change of Control (CoC): Traditionally, a change of control of the borrower constituted an event of default and/or triggered an immediate mandatory prepayment of the entire loan.6 However, the market has seen a shift towards more flexible CoC provisions. These include "lender put rights" (giving each lender the option to demand prepayment, sometimes at a premium, similar to bondholder rights) or, more significantly, "portability" features. Portability allows the CoC mandatory prepayment to be waived if certain conditions are met, such as the borrower maintaining specified leverage ratios or credit ratings post-acquisition.38 This latter development is a significant departure, as it can compel existing lenders to remain in a credit facility under new ownership, potentially altering the credit risk profile they initially underwrote. While beneficial for selling sponsors by enhancing the marketability of portfolio companies, it challenges the traditional "know your borrower" tenet for lenders.
Prepayment Waterfalls: In transactions involving multiple tranches of debt (e.g., first lien and second lien loans, or pari passu term loans and notes), the credit agreement or intercreditor agreement will specify a "prepayment waterfall." This dictates how mandatory prepayment proceeds are allocated among the different classes of debt, ensuring that proceeds are applied on a pro rata basis among pari passu creditors or sequentially to different priority tranches according to their agreed ranking.38
The negotiation of mandatory prepayment provisions, including the scope of exceptions, thresholds, reinvestment rights, and the definition of events like Change of Control, is a critical area where the borrower's desire for financial flexibility directly conflicts with the lender's objective of accelerated deleveraging and risk mitigation. The evolution of these terms, often towards greater borrower latitude, is a strong indicator of shifts in negotiating power within the leveraged finance market.
C. Representations and Warranties: Purpose, Scope, and Consequences of Breach
Representations and warranties are fundamental components of any credit agreement, serving as statements of fact by the borrower concerning its legal, financial, and operational status, which induce the lenders to enter into the transaction and extend credit.6
Definition and Purpose:
A representation is an assertion as to a factual matter, made as of a specific date (typically the date of the agreement and, for certain "repeating representations," on subsequent dates such as drawdown dates or interest payment dates), intended to persuade the other party to enter into the contract.43
A warranty is a promise that a particular statement is true, coupled with an implicit or explicit undertaking to indemnify the other party if the statement proves false.43 In practice, the terms are often used interchangeably in loan agreements.
The primary purposes of representations and warranties in a loan context are: (i) to provide lenders with a verified "snapshot" of the borrower's condition at the time of entering into the loan and at key subsequent points; (ii) to allocate risk between the borrower and lenders regarding the accuracy of these statements; and (iii) to encourage full disclosure by the borrower of all material information relevant to the credit decision (a process sometimes referred to as "smoking out the facts").44 While "representation" and "warranty" possess distinct legal definitions and historical remedies, their practical differentiation within the framework of a modern credit agreement is often diminished. This is because the agreement itself contractually stipulates the consequences of any inaccuracy or breach of these statements—typically classifying such an event as a Default or an Event of Default.43 Consequently, the legal practitioner's focus shifts more towards the substantive content, scope, timing (especially repetition), and precise wording of each representation, rather than a strict adherence to the semantic distinction between the two terms. The contractually defined remedy, usually an Event of Default leading to potential acceleration and enforcement, becomes the primary enforcement mechanism.
Typical Representations in LMA Leveraged Finance Agreements: While the specific suite of representations will be tailored to the transaction, a typical LMA-based leveraged facilities agreement will include, among others, assertions regarding 6:
Status and Corporate Power: Due incorporation, valid existence, good standing, and the power and authority to enter into and perform its obligations under the finance documents.
Binding Obligations: The finance documents constitute legal, valid, binding, and enforceable obligations of the borrower and any guarantors.
Non-Conflict: Execution and performance of the finance documents do not conflict with the borrower's constitutional documents, applicable laws, or other material agreements.
Financial Statements: The borrower's financial statements provided to lenders were prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), fairly present its financial condition, and (for audited statements) give a true and fair view. The negotiation of representations concerning the accuracy of financial statements and the absence of misleading information is paramount, as these form the informational bedrock of the lenders' credit assessment. Any qualifications to these representations, such as "to the best of knowledge" for information provided, or specific interpretations of GAAP for financial reporting, can materially alter the allocation of risk and the lenders' recourse if such information later proves to be inaccurate or incomplete.
No Material Adverse Change (MAC): No material adverse change has occurred in the borrower's business, assets, operations, or financial condition since the date of the last audited financial statements.
No Default: No Event of Default or Potential Event of Default is continuing or would result from the making of a loan.
Misleading Information: All factual information provided by the borrower to the lenders in connection with the transaction was true and accurate in all material respects as of the date it was provided and not misleading in any material respect.
Litigation: No litigation, arbitration, or administrative proceedings are current or, to its knowledge, pending or threatened that could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.
Compliance with Laws: The borrower is in compliance with all applicable laws, regulations, and authorizations, including environmental laws, anti-corruption laws, sanctions, and anti-money laundering regulations.
Taxation: The borrower has paid all material taxes due and is not required to make any tax withholding or deduction from payments due under the finance documents.
Security and Guarantees: All security interests granted are valid, perfected (or capable of perfection), and create the intended priority. All guarantees are valid and enforceable.
Ownership of Assets and Intellectual Property: The borrower has good title to its material assets, and owns or has the right to use all intellectual property material to its business.
Pari Passu Ranking: The obligations under the finance documents rank at least pari passu with all its other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness.
Solvency: The borrower is solvent and will not become insolvent as a result of incurring the debt.
Timing and Repetition: Representations are made on the date the credit agreement is signed. Crucially, a subset of these representations, known as "Repeating Representations," are deemed to be repeated on the date of each utilisation request, on each utilisation date, and often on the first day of each interest period.29 This mechanism transforms static statements into ongoing conditions for the availability of funds and the continuation of the facility. A breach of a repeating representation can prevent further drawdowns and may constitute an Event of Default, even if no payment has been missed, providing lenders with a powerful monitoring and control tool.
Qualifications: Representations may be subject to negotiated qualifications, such as "materiality" thresholds (i.e., the representation need only be true in all material respects), knowledge qualifiers ("to the best of the borrower's knowledge" after due inquiry), or by reference to specific matters disclosed to the lenders in writing prior to signing.
Consequences of Breach or Inaccuracy: An inaccurate representation made at signing, or a repeating representation that is untrue when deemed repeated, typically constitutes an Event of Default (or a Default that can mature into an Event of Default if not remedied within any applicable cure period).43 This can entitle lenders to:
Refuse to make further loans or issue letters of credit.29
Cancel undrawn commitments.
Declare all outstanding loans immediately due and payable (acceleration).
Enforce security interests.
Charge default interest.
The LMA Leveraged Facilities Agreement contains a comprehensive set of standard representations, and the ACT Borrower's Guide provides insights into common areas of negotiation from the borrower's standpoint.16 The precise scope and wording of each representation are critical, as they define the baseline factual assumptions for the transaction and the triggers for potential lender action.
D. Covenants: Protecting Lender Interests and Borrower Operational Flexibility
Covenants are contractual promises made by the borrower (and guarantors) within the credit agreement to conduct its business in a certain manner or to refrain from specific actions throughout the term of the loan.6 They are a primary tool for lenders to mitigate credit risk, monitor the borrower's performance, and protect their interests post-closing. A breach of a covenant typically constitutes a technical default, which, if not waived or cured (where permissible), can escalate into an Event of Default, entitling lenders to exercise their remedies.46
1. Types of Covenants: Affirmative, Negative, and Financial
Covenants are broadly categorized as follows:
Affirmative (or Positive) Covenants: These stipulate actions that the borrower must perform or conditions it must maintain. Their purpose is often to ensure the borrower operates in a prudent manner, maintains its legal status and assets, and provides lenders with ongoing information.
Common Examples (often found in LMA-based agreements):
Maintenance of legal existence and corporate status.
Payment of taxes and other obligations when due.
Compliance with all applicable laws and regulations (including environmental, anti-corruption, and sanctions laws).
Maintenance of properties, assets, and appropriate insurance coverage.
Provision of regular financial statements (e.g., annual audited, quarterly unaudited) and other information, such as compliance certificates (confirming adherence to financial covenants and absence of defaults), and notices of default or material litigation.6
Permitting lenders or their representatives to conduct inspections or audits (subject to agreed limitations).
Negative Covenants: These restrict the borrower from undertaking certain actions without obtaining prior consent from the lenders (or a specified majority thereof). Negative covenants are particularly crucial in leveraged loans, as they aim to prevent actions that could increase the lenders' risk, diminish the value of their collateral, or leak value out of the restricted group of companies that support the credit.
Common Examples (often found in LMA-based agreements):
Limitation on Indebtedness: Restricting the incurrence of additional financial debt, subject to permitted "baskets" or allowances for specific types of debt (e.g., refinancing debt, capital lease obligations, intercompany debt, acquisition debt) or if certain financial ratios are met ("ratio debt").6
Limitation on Liens (Negative Pledge): Prohibiting the creation of security interests over the borrower's assets in favor of other creditors, unless the existing lenders are equally and ratably secured, subject to permitted lien baskets (e.g., liens securing permitted purchase money debt, statutory liens, liens existing at closing).6
Limitation on Asset Sales (Disposals): Restricting the sale, lease, transfer, or other disposal of assets, particularly material assets, outside the ordinary course of business. Exceptions typically allow for disposals up to certain value thresholds, sales of obsolete assets, or if proceeds are reinvested in the business or used to prepay the loan.6
Limitation on Investments, Loans, and Acquisitions: Restricting the borrower from making investments in, or loans to, third parties or other group companies (especially those outside the guarantor group), and from making acquisitions, subject to permitted baskets and ratio tests.6
Limitation on Restricted Payments (RP Covenant): Controlling the outflow of cash or assets from the borrower and its restricted subsidiaries to equity holders (e.g., dividends, share repurchases) or to repay subordinated debt. These covenants often include complex "builder baskets" based on a percentage of consolidated net income, plus other specific allowances.21
Limitation on Mergers and Consolidations: Prohibiting mergers or consolidations unless the surviving entity assumes all obligations and certain financial tests are met.
Limitation on Changes to Business: Restricting fundamental changes to the nature of the borrower's business.
Limitation on Transactions with Affiliates: Requiring that any transactions with affiliated entities are conducted on arm's length terms, to prevent value extraction from the credit group.21
Limitation on Amendments: Restricting amendments to the borrower's constitutional documents or material agreements in a manner adverse to lenders. The negotiation of "permitted baskets" within these negative covenants is a critical aspect of credit agreement drafting. These baskets are not merely minor exceptions; they represent carefully negotiated allowances that can provide substantial capacity for the borrower to undertake actions that would otherwise be prohibited. "Grower baskets," which expand based on metrics like EBITDA or total assets, and "builder baskets" (particularly in RP covenants), which accumulate capacity based on net income or equity contributions, can create significant, and sometimes unpredictable, flexibility for borrowers.6 This necessitates a thorough legal analysis of how these baskets are defined, how they interact, and their potential to dilute the restrictive intent of the core covenant.
Financial Covenants: These require the borrower to maintain its financial condition and performance within certain pre-agreed parameters, tested periodically (typically quarterly) or upon the occurrence of specific events. They serve as key early warning indicators of potential financial distress.
Common Examples (in LMA leveraged deals, often including 6):
Leverage Ratio: Total Debt to EBITDA (or Senior Debt to EBITDA) not to exceed a specified multiple.
Interest Coverage Ratio: EBITDA to Interest Expense (or Cash Interest Expense) to be not less than a specified multiple.
Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio: Similar to interest cover but may include other fixed charges like lease payments or scheduled principal amortisation.
Cash Flow Cover Ratio: Measures ability to service debt from operating cash flow.
Capital Expenditure (Capex) Limitation: Restricting annual capital expenditures to an agreed amount. The distinction between "maintenance" and "incurrence" financial covenants is fundamental. Maintenance covenants require regular, periodic testing (e.g., quarterly). A breach allows lenders to act even if no payment default has occurred. These are traditional in LMA-style term loan A facilities and bank-led deals.4 Incurrence covenants, by contrast, are tested only when the borrower proposes to take a specific action, such as incurring additional debt, making a significant investment, or paying a large dividend. If the borrower meets the relevant ratio test on a pro forma basis for the action, it is permitted; if not, the action is prohibited (unless permitted by a specific basket). Incurrence covenants are characteristic of high-yield bonds and have become prevalent in "covenant-lite" term loan B facilities.4 This shift towards incurrence-based covenants in the leveraged loan market signifies a considerable transfer of operational freedom to borrowers and their private equity sponsors, as it reduces the frequency of lender intervention points.
2. Key Negative Covenants: Debt, Liens, Restricted Payments (RP Covenants), Asset Sales, Affiliate Transactions
While all covenants are important, certain negative covenants are central to protecting the lenders' position in a leveraged financing by controlling the borrower's ability to alter its risk profile or dissipate value. The detailed mechanics of these often draw from high-yield indenture technology, especially in sponsor-backed deals.21
Limitation on Debt: This covenant restricts the borrower and its restricted subsidiaries from incurring additional financial indebtedness. The core restriction is usually supplemented by a series of "permitted debt baskets," which allow for specific types or amounts of debt without requiring lender consent (e.g., debt under the existing credit facilities, limited amounts of capital lease and purchase money debt, debt existing at closing, intercompany debt within the restricted group, and a general purpose debt basket). A key feature is often a "ratio debt" permission, allowing unlimited incurrence of certain types of debt (e.g., unsecured debt, or sometimes secured debt subject to a separate leverage test) provided a specified financial ratio, typically a fixed charge coverage ratio or a leverage ratio, is met on a pro forma basis.21
Limitation on Liens (Negative Pledge): This covenant prohibits the borrower and its restricted subsidiaries from creating or permitting to exist any security interests (liens) on their assets, other than "permitted liens." The purpose is to protect the priority of the lenders' security package. Permitted liens typically include liens securing the credit agreement itself, liens existing at closing, certain statutory liens (like tax or mechanics' liens), judgment liens (subject to limits), and liens securing specific categories of permitted debt (e.g., purchase money debt secured by the acquired asset, or liens permitted under a general lien basket or a ratio-based secured debt allowance).6
Limitation on Restricted Payments (RP Covenant): This is one of the most complex and heavily negotiated covenants. It governs the ability of the borrower and its restricted subsidiaries to make payments or distributions that move value outside the "credit box" (the group of entities obligated under the loan). "Restricted Payments" typically include 21:
Dividends and other distributions on equity.
Purchases, redemptions, or retirements of equity interests.
Payments (principal, interest, or defeasance) on subordinated indebtedness before its scheduled maturity.
Investments in entities or assets that are not restricted subsidiaries (including investments in unrestricted subsidiaries). The RP covenant usually operates via a "builder basket" that accumulates capacity based on a percentage (often 50%) of the borrower's consolidated net income (CNI) since the closing date (with deductions for net losses), plus proceeds from new equity issuances and certain other items. Access to this builder basket is often conditioned on the absence of a default and, sometimes, on meeting a financial ratio test. Alongside the builder basket, there are typically numerous specific "permitted payment" baskets allowing for certain RP_s up to fixed dollar amounts or based on grower formulas (e.g., a percentage of EBITDA or total assets).21
Limitation on Asset Sales: This covenant regulates the disposal of assets by the borrower and its restricted subsidiaries. It typically does not prohibit asset sales altogether but imposes conditions, such as requiring that sales be made for fair market value and that a significant portion (e.g., 75%) of the consideration be received in cash.6 Net cash proceeds from asset sales (above a certain de minimis threshold or annual basket) are usually required to be either reinvested in productive assets for the business within a specified timeframe (e.g., 12-18 months) or used to make a prepayment offer to lenders.
Limitation on Transactions with Affiliates: To prevent value leakage to related parties (such as the private equity sponsor or its other portfolio companies), this covenant generally requires that transactions between the borrower or its restricted subsidiaries and their affiliates be on terms no less favorable than those that could be obtained in an arm's-length transaction with an unrelated third party.21 Material affiliate transactions may require approval from the borrower's board of directors or a committee of independent directors. Exceptions typically exist for transactions wholly within the restricted group, employment and compensation arrangements, and sometimes for specific sponsor-related fees or transactions if disclosed and agreed.
The interconnectedness of these negative covenants and their associated baskets is a critical area of legal analysis. Capacity created or used under one covenant's basket (e.g., making a permitted investment in an unrestricted subsidiary using an RP basket) can have knock-on effects or enable actions that might seem contrary to the spirit of another covenant (e.g., that unrestricted subsidiary then incurs debt or disposes of the invested assets free from the main credit agreement's restrictions). This necessitates a holistic review of the entire covenant package to understand the true extent of borrower flexibility and potential risks for lenders. Furthermore, subjective standards like "fair market value" in asset sale covenants or "arm's length terms" in affiliate transaction covenants can become sources of dispute, particularly if the mechanisms for determining compliance are not clearly defined in the legal documentation.21
3. Financial Covenants: Maintenance vs. Incurrence; EBITDA Adjustments and Calculations
Financial covenants are specific, numerically-defined tests that a borrower must satisfy, serving as quantitative measures of its financial health and ability to service its debt.4
Maintenance Covenants vs. Incurrence Covenants:
Maintenance Covenants: These require the borrower to meet specified financial ratio tests at regular intervals, typically at the end of each fiscal quarter, regardless of whether the borrower is taking any particular action.4 A breach of a maintenance covenant usually constitutes an Event of Default (or a Default that can ripen into one), allowing lenders to exercise remedies even if the borrower has not missed a payment. These are characteristic of traditional bank lending and LMA TLA facilities.
Incurrence Covenants: These are tested only when the borrower proposes to undertake a specific action that is otherwise restricted by a negative covenant, such as incurring additional debt, making an acquisition, paying a dividend, or making certain investments.4 If the borrower can demonstrate that, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the proposed action, it would be in compliance with the relevant financial ratio, the action is permitted. If not, the action is prohibited (unless capacity exists under a specific basket). Incurrence covenants provide greater operational flexibility and are the hallmark of high-yield bonds and "covenant-lite" leveraged loans. The widespread adoption of covenant-lite structures in the TLB market, driven by sponsor demand and periods of ample market liquidity, has fundamentally altered the risk-reward proposition for institutional lenders. While offering borrowers significant operational freedom, it delays potential lender intervention until problems are potentially more severe, thereby increasing the risk of lower ultimate recoveries for lenders. This shift is accepted by many institutional investors in exchange for potentially higher yields and the ability to deploy large amounts of capital.
"Covenant-Lite" and "Covenant-Loose" Structures:
A "covenant-lite" loan typically contains no financial maintenance covenants applicable to the term loan lenders.4
A "covenant-loose" structure might include one financial maintenance covenant, often a leverage ratio, but it might be set with very generous headroom or may only "spring" into effect for the benefit of revolving credit facility lenders when RCF drawings exceed a specified threshold (e.g., 30-40% of commitments).6 For term loan lenders in such a structure, the loan effectively behaves like a covenant-lite facility unless the RCF springing covenant is triggered and breached.
EBITDA Definition and Adjustments (Add-backs): The definition of Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (EBITDA) is arguably the most critical financial definition in a leveraged loan agreement, as it forms the basis for most financial ratio calculations (e.g., leverage, interest coverage). This definition is invariably subject to intense negotiation, with borrowers (especially those backed by private equity sponsors) seeking to include a wide array of "add-backs" or adjustments that increase reported EBITDA.5 Common add-backs include:
Synergies and cost savings anticipated from acquisitions or restructuring initiatives (often permitted even if not yet realized, and sometimes with limited timeframes for achievement or verification).
Restructuring charges and non-recurring expenses.
Transaction costs related to acquisitions, debt issuances, or equity offerings.
Stock-based compensation and other non-cash charges. While traditional LMA documentation was historically more conservative regarding the scope and scale of EBITDA add-backs compared to U.S. high-yield or sponsor-driven terms, there has been a significant convergence, with European deals increasingly incorporating more permissive add-back regimes.13 Lenders may seek to impose caps on the aggregate amount of certain types of add-backs (e.g., limiting projected synergies to a percentage of reported EBITDA). The permissiveness of EBITDA add-backs, especially for prospective synergies and cost savings that may not materialize, can create a substantial disconnect between reported covenant compliance and the actual underlying economic performance of the borrower. This makes robust due diligence on the quality of earnings and the reasonableness and achievability of proposed add-backs a critical exercise for lenders and their legal advisors.
Equity Cures: Many leveraged loan agreements, particularly those for sponsor-backed borrowers, include "equity cure" provisions.6 These allow the private equity sponsor (or other equity holders) to "cure" a breach of a financial maintenance covenant by making an equity contribution to the borrower. The proceeds of this equity injection are then typically treated, for the purpose of recalculating the breached covenant, as an addition to EBITDA for the relevant testing period or, less commonly, as a reduction of debt.
Equity cure rights are usually subject to limitations, such as the number of times they can be exercised during the life of the loan (e.g., no more than five times in total) or within a given period (e.g., not in consecutive quarters, or no more than two cures in any four-quarter period).
The legal terms of the cure, such as whether the cure amount is deemed to be EBITDA (which improves ratios but doesn't necessarily improve actual cash flow or reduce debt) versus being applied to actual debt paydown, and the limitations on their use, are key negotiation points. While providing a lifeline for borrowers and protecting sponsors' equity value, equity cures can also serve to delay necessary operational restructurings or an inevitable default, potentially to the detriment of lenders if the underlying business issues remain unaddressed.
4. The Role of Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries
The designation of subsidiaries as either "Restricted" or "Unrestricted" is a critical structural element in leveraged finance credit agreements, with profound implications for the scope of covenant application, the guarantor and collateral package, and the potential for value leakage.21
Restricted Subsidiaries: These are subsidiaries of the borrower that are bound by the full covenant package of the credit agreement. They typically form the core "credit group" and are usually required to provide guarantees for the borrower's obligations and grant security over their assets. The financial results of restricted subsidiaries are consolidated with those of the borrower for the purpose of financial covenant calculations and determining capacity under various baskets (e.g., for debt, investments, restricted payments).
Unrestricted Subsidiaries: These are subsidiaries specifically designated by the borrower (to the extent permitted by the credit agreement) to be outside the scope of most of the credit agreement's covenants and obligations.21 Consequently:
They do not provide guarantees for the main credit facilities.
They do not grant security over their assets for the main credit facilities.
Their financial performance (e.g., EBITDA, net income) is typically excluded from the consolidated calculations for the restricted group's covenant compliance (though dividends received by the restricted group from unrestricted subsidiaries may sometimes be included in CNI or EBITDA).
Transactions between the restricted group and unrestricted subsidiaries are generally treated as if they were transactions with unrelated third parties and are subject to the limitations in the covenants (e.g., the restricted payments covenant for investments in, or affiliate transactions covenant for dealings with, unrestricted subsidiaries). The unrestricted subsidiary designation, while a standard feature often intended for legitimate operational flexibility (such as for joint ventures, non-core assets, specially financed projects, or entities subject to specific regulatory regimes that preclude guarantees or liens 21), has become a central mechanism in aggressive liability management exercises. These LMEs have seen borrowers transfer valuable assets or entire business lines to unrestricted subsidiaries, thereby shielding those assets from the claims of existing lenders or using them to raise new, structurally senior debt.52 This exploitation of covenant loopholes has led to significant lender concern and litigation.
Strategic Use and "Blocker" Provisions: The controversial use of unrestricted subsidiaries in LMEs like those undertaken by J.Crew (IP transfer), PetSmart (Chewy stock transfer), Neiman Marcus (MyTheresa spin-off), and Envision Healthcare (AmSurg designation) has spurred the development of specific covenant protections known as "blockers".36
"J.Crew Blockers" aim to prevent the transfer of material intellectual property or other "crown jewel" assets to unrestricted subsidiaries or other non-loan parties, or cap investments in such entities.
"Chewy Blockers" (or PetSmart blockers) are designed to prevent the release of subsidiary guarantees and collateral merely because a guarantor becomes non-wholly owned through a stock transfer, unless it's part of a bona fide third-party transaction.
"Envision Blockers" seek to limit the aggregate capacity for investments in, or transfers of assets to, unrestricted subsidiaries by ensuring that only specific, clearly defined baskets can be used for such purposes, rather than allowing the combination of multiple general-purpose baskets. The development of these named "blocker" provisions illustrates a reactive cycle in legal drafting: as borrowers and sponsors devise new methods to exploit perceived loopholes, particularly those involving unrestricted subsidiaries, lenders and their counsel respond by crafting more specific and targeted prohibitions. This dynamic contributes to the increasing complexity and bespoke nature of covenant packages in leveraged finance. However, the effectiveness of such blockers is not absolute; it depends on their precise wording, their interaction with other covenant baskets (such as general investment or dividend capacity), and the voting thresholds required to amend or waive them. A well-drafted blocker can still potentially be circumvented if other avenues for value transfer remain open or if a requisite majority of lenders can be persuaded to approve an amendment.
E. Events of Default (EoDs) and Lender Remedies
Events of Default are contractually defined occurrences or circumstances that signify a material deterioration in the borrower's creditworthiness or a breach of its obligations under the credit agreement. Upon the occurrence and continuation of an EoD, lenders are typically entitled to exercise a range of remedies, including demanding immediate repayment of all outstanding amounts.6
Common Events of Default: While the specific list can vary, LMA-based leveraged facilities agreements typically include the following EoDs 6:
Non-payment: Failure to pay principal, interest, or fees when due (often with a short grace period for interest or fees, but rarely for principal).
Breach of Financial Covenants: Failure to comply with financial ratio tests (e.g., leverage, interest cover). For maintenance covenants, this is often an immediate EoD or has a very limited grace period.65
Breach of Other Covenants: Violation of affirmative or negative covenants (other than financial covenants). These breaches often have a cure period (e.g., 15-30 days) if the breach is deemed "capable of remedy" before maturing into an EoD.65 The definition of what constitutes "capable of remedy" can itself be a point of legal interpretation and negotiation.
Misrepresentation: Any representation or warranty made by the borrower proving to have been incorrect or misleading in any material respect when made or deemed repeated.
Cross-Default / Cross-Acceleration: A default or acceleration occurring under other material financial indebtedness of the borrower or its material subsidiaries.
Insolvency Events: The borrower or a material subsidiary becoming insolvent, admitting inability to pay debts, commencing bankruptcy, administration, liquidation, or similar insolvency proceedings, or having such proceedings instituted against it (and not dismissed within a specified period).
Invalidity of Loan Documents: Any provision of a loan document or security document ceasing to be legal, valid, binding, or enforceable.
Unlawfulness and Invalidity of Security: It becoming unlawful for an obligor to perform its obligations, or security becoming unenforceable or ranking lower than intended.
Material Judgments: A final judgment or order for the payment of money exceeding a certain threshold is rendered against an obligor and not discharged or stayed within a specified period.
Cessation of Business: The borrower or a material part of the group suspending or ceasing to carry on all or a substantial part of its business.29
Material Adverse Change (MAC): An event or circumstance occurs that has or is reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on the borrower's business, financial condition, or ability to perform its obligations under the finance documents.29 While a standard EoD, the MAC clause is notoriously difficult for lenders to successfully invoke due to its high and often subjective threshold. Lenders generally prefer to rely on "hard" breaches (like non-payment or financial covenant violations) due to the significant litigation risk and potential reputational damage associated with a wrongful MAC declaration. Its primary utility may lie as a deterrent or a point of leverage in negotiations, or as a condition to further drawdowns under a revolving facility if a "no MAC" representation must be true.
Change of Control: A change in the ownership or control of the borrower, unless the facility includes portability provisions or the lenders have a put right.6
Audit Qualification: The borrower's auditors qualifying their audit report or stating that there is doubt about the borrower's ability to continue as a going concern.
Expropriation/Nationalization: Assets of the borrower group are condemned, seized, or nationalized.
Cure Periods (Grace Periods): Certain EoDs, particularly breaches of non-financial covenants, may be subject to a negotiated cure period, allowing the borrower time to remedy the breach before it crystallizes into an actionable EoD.65 The availability and length of cure periods are key negotiation points, balancing the borrower's need for operational flexibility against the lenders' need for timely intervention.
"Defaulting Lender" Provisions (LMA): Introduced by the LMA following the 2008 financial crisis, these provisions address the scenario where a lender within the syndicate fails to meet its funding obligations (e.g., due to its own insolvency or unwillingness to lend).64 These clauses are designed to maintain the operational integrity of the syndicated loan by:
Allowing the borrower to replace the Defaulting Lender (a "yank the bank" provision).
Disenfranchising the Defaulting Lender from voting on matters related to its undrawn commitments.
Potentially requiring the Defaulting Lender to provide cash cover for its share of letters of credit. These provisions represent a significant legal innovation aimed at mitigating the systemic risk posed by the failure of an individual syndicate member.
Lender Remedies upon Event of Default: Once an EoD has occurred and is continuing (and any applicable cure periods have expired), lenders typically have the right to 51:
Acceleration: Declare all outstanding principal, accrued interest, and other amounts immediately due and payable.
Cancellation of Commitments: Terminate any undrawn commitments, preventing further borrowing.
Enforcement of Security: Instruct the security agent to take steps to enforce the security package (e.g., take possession of, appoint a receiver over, or sell collateralized assets).
Charging Default Interest: Impose a higher rate of interest on overdue amounts.
Set-Off: Apply any credit balances held by the lenders for the borrower against the outstanding debt.
Legal Action: Initiate legal proceedings against the borrower and any guarantors to recover the debt, including potentially petitioning for the borrower's bankruptcy. It is important to note that lenders do not always immediately resort to enforcement upon an EoD. They may choose to negotiate a waiver of the default (often in exchange for a fee, an increased margin, or tighter covenant terms), enter into a forbearance agreement (agreeing not to exercise remedies for a specified period while a solution is sought), or agree to an amendment of the credit agreement to address the underlying cause of the default.51
F. The Security Package in LMA Leveraged Loans
Given the higher credit risk associated with leveraged borrowers, a robust security package is a cornerstone of leveraged loan transactions, designed to provide lenders with recourse to the borrower's and guarantors' assets in a default scenario, thereby mitigating potential losses and improving recovery prospects.6 The comprehensiveness of this package is a direct function of the borrower's weaker credit profile, contrasting with investment-grade lending where unsecured deals are more common.20 The LMA Leveraged Facilities Agreement inherently assumes a secured transaction structure, typically involving guarantees from material operating companies.19
Typical Components in LMA-Style Transactions:
Guarantees: These are contractual promises by third parties (typically other companies within the borrower's group) to satisfy the borrower's obligations if the borrower fails to do so.
Upstream Guarantees: Provided by subsidiary companies for the obligations of their parent company (the borrower). These require careful legal consideration regarding corporate benefit and potential financial assistance prohibitions in various jurisdictions.
Downstream Guarantees: Provided by a parent company for the obligations of its subsidiary borrower.
Cross-Stream Guarantees: Provided between sister companies within the borrower's group.
The scope of guarantees often aims to capture all material operating companies within the group, frequently defined by thresholds based on their contribution to the group's consolidated assets, revenue, or EBITDA (e.g., a "Guarantor Coverage test" requiring guarantors to represent a certain percentage, such as 80-85%, of group EBITDA or assets).6
Asset Security: This involves granting lenders security interests (charges, mortgages, pledges) over specific assets or categories of assets.
All-Asset Debenture (UK context): A common feature in UK-based leveraged finance, this is a comprehensive security document granted by English companies, creating fixed charges over specific assets (e.g., real estate, intellectual property, major contracts, equipment) and a floating charge over all other (present and future) assets not subject to a fixed charge.11 The floating charge "crystallizes" into a fixed charge upon certain events, such as default or insolvency.
Share Pledges/Charges: Security taken over the shares of the borrower itself (if the borrower is a subsidiary) and, critically, over the shares of its material operating subsidiaries.11 This allows lenders, upon enforcement, to take control of these subsidiaries.
Security over Specific Assets: Depending on the nature of the borrower's business and the jurisdictions involved, specific security may be taken over:
Bank Accounts: Often through fixed charges and account control agreements, giving the security agent control over funds upon default.67
Real Estate: Legal mortgages or charges over land and buildings.11
Intellectual Property: Assignments or charges over patents, trademarks, copyrights, and domain names.
Material Contracts: Assignments of rights under key commercial contracts (e.g., major supply or customer agreements).
Insurance Policies: Assignments of proceeds from material insurance policies.
Receivables: Assignments or charges over trade debts and other receivables.
Perfection of Security: Perfection refers to the legal steps required to make a security interest effective against the grantor and, crucially, against third parties (such as other creditors, a liquidator, or administrator in insolvency). The requirements for perfection vary significantly depending on the type of asset, the type of security interest, and the jurisdiction where the asset is located or the obligor is incorporated. Common perfection steps include registration of charges at public registries (e.g., at Companies House in the UK for charges created by English companies 6), giving notice to contractual counterparties, or taking possession or control of certain types of assets.67 Failure to properly perfect security can render it void or subordinate it to other claims in an insolvency.
Priority of Security: The ranking of security interests (i.e., which secured creditor gets paid first from the proceeds of the secured assets) is determined by a combination of factors: the type of security interest (e.g., fixed charges generally rank ahead of floating charges), the order of creation and perfection ("first-in-time, first-in-right" is a general principle 6), and, most importantly in complex structures, the terms of any applicable Intercreditor Agreement.
Intercreditor Agreements (ICAs): When a borrower has multiple layers or types of debt (e.g., super senior revolving facilities, senior term loans, second lien loans, mezzanine debt, high-yield bonds), an ICA is essential.9 These legally binding agreements are entered into by the different classes of creditors and the borrower/guarantors to regulate their respective rights and priorities. Key provisions in an ICA include:
Ranking of Debt and Liens: Defining whether subordination is at the debt level ("payment subordination," where junior debt cannot be paid until senior debt is satisfied) or merely at the lien level ("lien subordination," where junior lienholders have a claim on collateral proceeds only after senior lienholders are paid from that collateral).10
Application of Enforcement Proceeds (Waterfall): Dictating the order in which proceeds from the enforcement of shared security are distributed (see Section II.G).
Control over Enforcement: Specifying which creditor class (usually the most senior) has the right to instruct the security agent to enforce the security and control the enforcement process.
Standstill Periods: Imposing periods during which junior creditors are prohibited from taking enforcement action or accelerating their debt, giving senior creditors time to manage a workout or restructuring.10
Release of Security and Guarantees: Provisions allowing for the release of security or guarantees upon certain events (e.g., asset disposals permitted by the senior lenders, or upon refinancing of the senior debt).
Rights in Insolvency: Regulating voting on insolvency plans, rights to provide debtor-in-possession (DIP) financing, and challenges to the validity or priority of other creditors' claims or security.10 The LMA publishes standard form ICAs, such as for super senior RCF and senior term loan structures, which provide a common baseline for negotiation.72 Shared lien structures, where a single security agent holds all security for the benefit of different creditor classes, are typical in LMA-style intercreditor arrangements.10 However, these templates are invariably subject to heavy negotiation to reflect the specific capital structure, the nature of the different debt instruments, and the relative bargaining power of the various creditor groups involved, especially with the increasing diversity of non-bank lenders and private credit funds in the market. ICAs are not merely administrative; they are critical in defining the balance of power and economic outcomes in distress or enforcement, and their negotiation can be as pivotal as the main credit agreement itself.
G. Waterfall Provisions: Application of Proceeds
Waterfall provisions are contractual clauses, typically found in intercreditor agreements or security documents, that meticulously dictate the order of priority in which cash flows or proceeds realized from the enforcement of collateral are distributed among various stakeholders after an Event of Default and the commencement of enforcement actions.7 These provisions are fundamental to understanding the risk and potential recovery for each class of creditor in a leveraged finance structure.
Operational Waterfall (Pre-Default): While the primary focus here is on post-default scenarios, it's useful to distinguish this from an operational cash flow waterfall. In certain structured financings like project finance, a highly defined pre-default waterfall governs the application of all project revenues: funds flow into controlled accounts and are disbursed in a strict order – operating expenses, taxes, agent fees, debt service (interest then principal), funding of reserve accounts, and finally, distributions to equity holders.7 While less formally structured in typical corporate leveraged loans, the principle of prioritizing debt service payments from operating cash flow before discretionary payments (like dividends) is embedded through covenants and general financial discipline.
Enforcement Waterfall (Post-Default): This is the critical mechanism activated upon the enforcement of security. The intercreditor agreement is the primary document outlining this waterfall.10 The typical order of priority in an LMA-style leveraged loan, though subject to deal-specific negotiation, generally follows this sequence:
Costs of Enforcement: Fees, costs, and expenses incurred by the security agent or other secured parties in connection with the preservation, realization, or enforcement of the security.
Super Senior Obligations: If the structure includes a super senior facility (e.g., a super senior revolving credit facility or certain types of hedging liabilities if granted super senior status in the ICA 9), these claims are paid first from enforcement proceeds.
Senior Secured Obligations: This typically includes first lien term loans and any other debt ranking pari passu with them (e.g., pari passu secured notes). Proceeds are distributed pro rata among creditors within this class based on their outstanding claims.10
Second Lien Secured Obligations: Claims secured by a second-ranking security interest over the common collateral pool.
Junior Secured Obligations: Any other debt secured by liens ranking junior to the second lien (e.g., mezzanine debt if it benefits from junior security 70).
Unsecured Obligations: Claims of unsecured creditors, which may include senior unsecured notes, subordinated notes, or deficiency claims of secured creditors to the extent their collateral proceeds were insufficient.
Shareholder Loans / Equity: Any remaining proceeds, after all debt obligations have been satisfied, would flow to subordinated shareholder loans and finally to equity holders. This is rare in an enforcement scenario involving a leveraged company, as proceeds are often insufficient to cover all debt claims.
Key Legal Considerations for Enforcement Waterfalls:
Pro Rata Sharing: Within each class of creditors holding the same priority (e.g., all first lien lenders), proceeds are typically shared on a pro rata basis according to the amount of their respective outstanding claims.10
Debt Caps: The intercreditor agreement may specify "debt caps," limiting the amount of debt that can rank at a particular level of priority in the waterfall.10 Any debt incurred beyond these caps might be treated as ranking lower in priority.
"Payment in Full": The definition of what constitutes "payment in full" for a senior class before proceeds flow to a junior class can be complex. It typically includes outstanding principal, accrued interest (including default interest, if applicable), fees, and certain expenses. Negotiations may occur around the inclusion of make-whole amounts or prepayment premiums.
Valuation of Non-Cash Proceeds: If collateral is realized for non-cash consideration (e.g., equity in a restructured entity, other securities), the valuation of such proceeds for waterfall application purposes can be contentious and may require specific valuation methodologies to be outlined in the ICA.
Leakage: Careful drafting is required to prevent "leakage" of value to junior stakeholders or equity through mechanisms that might bypass the strict enforcement waterfall, such as permitted payments or asset transfers occurring prior to default or outside the direct control of the enforcing security agent. The enforcement waterfall is where the legal priorities established by security documents and intercreditor agreements translate into tangible economic recoveries for different creditor constituencies. Its precise structure and the definitions underpinning it are therefore critical determinants of risk and return, making it a focal point of intense negotiation among creditor groups. The ranking of specific liabilities, such as hedging termination payments 9, can also significantly impact recoveries for other lenders if these obligations are substantial and rank at a senior level in the waterfall.

Covenant Category
Specific Covenant Example
Purpose of Covenant
Typical LMA Formulation/Key Negotiation Points (Illustrative)
Common Breach Implications
Affirmative
Financial Reporting
Ensure lenders receive timely and accurate financial information to monitor borrower's performance and compliance.
Deliver annual audited and quarterly unaudited financials, compliance certificates, budgets, notice of defaults. Negotiation on timing, scope, and specific information requirements.6
Failure to deliver can be an EoD after a grace period. May indicate underlying financial problems.


Maintenance of Existence & Properties
Ensure borrower remains a valid legal entity and maintains its key operating assets.
Maintain legal existence, pay taxes, keep properties in good repair, maintain insurance. Negotiation on materiality of properties and scope of insurance.6
EoD if not complied with, potentially impacting operational viability and collateral value.


Compliance with Laws
Ensure borrower operates lawfully, avoiding fines, sanctions, or operational disruptions.
Comply with all applicable laws, including environmental, anti-corruption, sanctions. Negotiation on materiality thresholds.6
Breach can lead to EoD, significant fines, reputational damage, and operational impact.
Negative
Limitation on Indebtedness
Prevent borrower from over-leveraging or incurring debt that could impair repayment of existing loans.
Restricts incurrence of new financial indebtedness. Key negotiation around permitted debt "baskets" (e.g., for capex, acquisitions, general purposes, ratio-based debt). LMA forms provide a framework, but baskets are heavily negotiated.6
Incurring prohibited debt is an EoD. Can alter capital structure and risk profile.


Limitation on Liens (Negative Pledge)
Protect lenders' security position by preventing other creditors from obtaining prior or equal claims on assets.
Prohibits granting security over assets. Key negotiation around "permitted lien" baskets (e.g., for purchase money debt, statutory liens, general basket, liens securing other permitted debt). LMA forms include standard negative pledge.6
Granting prohibited liens is an EoD. Can subordinate existing lenders' security.


Limitation on Restricted Payments (RP Covenant)
Control outflow of cash/assets to equity holders or junior debt, preserving value within the credit group.
Restricts dividends, share buybacks, investments in non-restricted subs, subordinated debt payments. Complex "builder baskets" (e.g., % of CNI) and fixed/grower baskets are heavily negotiated. Definitions of CNI and other terms are critical.6
Making prohibited RPs is an EoD. Can significantly reduce assets available for debt service.


Limitation on Asset Sales
Prevent disposal of key assets that generate revenue or form part of collateral; ensure fair value is received.
Restricts asset sales outside ordinary course. Requires proceeds to be reinvested or used for debt prepayment. Fair market value and cash consideration requirements. Negotiation on reinvestment periods and permitted uses of proceeds.6
Prohibited asset sales are an EoD. Can diminish borrower's earning capacity or collateral value.


Limitation on Transactions with Affiliates
Prevent value leakage from the credit group to related parties through non-arm's length deals.
Requires affiliate transactions to be on arm's length terms or approved by disinterested directors. Exceptions for intercompany transactions within restricted group, compensation, etc..6
Non-arm's length transactions that are prohibited constitute an EoD.
Financial
Leverage Ratio (e.g., Total Debt / EBITDA)
Measure borrower's overall indebtedness relative to its earnings capacity.
Maximum ratio not to be exceeded. Tested quarterly (maintenance) or on incurrence. EBITDA definition and add-backs are critical negotiation points. LMA standard is maintenance, but cov-lite (incurrence only or springing) is common for TLBs.6
Breach is an EoD (often with no/short cure for maintenance). Key indicator of financial health.


Interest Coverage Ratio (e.g., EBITDA / Interest Expense)
Measure borrower's ability to service its interest obligations from earnings.
Minimum ratio to be maintained. Tested quarterly (maintenance) or on incurrence. EBITDA and Interest Expense definitions are key. LMA standard is maintenance.6
Breach is an EoD (often with no/short cure for maintenance). Indicates pressure on debt servicing capacity.


Capital Expenditure (Capex) Limitation
Control spending on fixed assets to preserve cash for debt service and operations.
Limits annual capex to an agreed amount, often with carry-forward/carry-back provisions. Less common in cov-lite deals. LMA may include as a maintenance covenant.6
Exceeding permitted capex is an EoD. Can impact liquidity if capex is debt-funded or unproductive.

III. Liability Management Exercises (LMEs) and Lender Protections: Navigating Contentious Terrain
In recent years, the landscape of leveraged finance has been significantly shaped by the rise of Liability Management Exercises (LMEs). These are transactions initiated by companies, often those backed by sophisticated private equity sponsors, to restructure their liabilities outside of formal bankruptcy proceedings. LMEs frequently involve exploiting flexibilities or perceived loopholes within existing credit agreements to alter the capital structure, often to the benefit of the company and certain participating creditors, but potentially to the detriment of others. This has led to a reactive evolution in credit documentation, with lenders seeking to incorporate new protective provisions, or "blockers," to guard against such maneuvers.
A. Overview of Common LME Strategies
LMEs encompass a range of techniques designed to address a company's balance sheet liabilities, driven by factors such as impending debt maturities, liquidity shortfalls, the desire to capture a discount on existing debt, or an effort to avoid a formal and costly insolvency process.74 The increasing prevalence of LMEs is, in part, a consequence of the borrower-friendly terms and loosened covenant packages that characterized credit markets during periods of high liquidity.55 These "loose" documents can provide borrowers with the contractual latitude to undertake complex and sometimes aggressive financial engineering.
Key LME strategies include:
Drop-down / Unrestricted Subsidiary Financings: This technique involves the transfer of valuable assets (such as intellectual property, a profitable business unit, or other "crown jewel" assets) from the borrower or its restricted subsidiaries (which are part of the existing credit group and subject to its covenants and collateral pledges) to an "unrestricted subsidiary".52 Because unrestricted subsidiaries are, by definition, outside the covenant perimeter of the existing credit agreement and their assets do not form part of the existing lenders' collateral package, these transferred assets can then be used to secure new debt incurred by the unrestricted subsidiary. This new debt is often structurally senior to the claims of the existing lenders with respect to the transferred assets. The proceeds from this new financing can be used for various purposes, including providing liquidity to the operating group or refinancing other debt.
Uptiering Exchanges (Priming Transactions): In an uptiering LME, a company, typically with the consent of a majority (but not all) of its existing lenders, amends its credit agreement to permit the issuance of new debt that ranks senior in priority (i.e., "primes") the existing debt with respect to collateral claims.36 The participating majority lenders then exchange their existing (now subordinated) debt for this new super-priority debt, often also providing new money to the company. Non-participating minority lenders are left holding debt that is effectively subordinated to the new priming facility, diminishing their recovery prospects. These transactions often rely on exploiting "open market purchase" exceptions to pro rata sharing provisions or other perceived loopholes in the amendment clauses of credit agreements.
Debt Buybacks, Tender Offers, and Exchange Offers: These are more traditional forms of LMEs where a company offers to repurchase its existing debt from holders, typically at a discount to par value, or to exchange existing debt instruments for new ones with different terms (e.g., extended maturities, modified interest rates, or different security status).74 While often less controversial than drop-downs or uptiering, these can still be structured in ways that are coercive or disadvantage certain groups of creditors.
The execution of these LMEs, particularly drop-downs and uptiering transactions, frequently leads to significant disputes and litigation, as non-participating or disadvantaged creditors challenge the legality and fairness of such maneuvers. This has given rise to the term "lender-on-lender violence," reflecting the often adversarial nature of these exercises where different factions of a lender group are pitted against each other.55
While LMEs can provide companies with much-needed liquidity or runway to address financial challenges, they are not always a panacea. Experience has shown that if the underlying operational or business issues are not resolved, an LME may only serve as a temporary fix, with a more comprehensive formal restructuring (such as a Chapter 11 bankruptcy) often following.58 However, the LME can significantly alter the negotiating leverage and the ultimate distribution of value in any subsequent formal insolvency proceeding by reordering priorities or stripping assets from the original credit group.
B. Case Studies in Liability Management and Resulting "Blocker" Provisions
The proliferation of aggressive LMEs has led to a corresponding evolution in credit agreement drafting, with lenders and their counsel developing specific contractual provisions—often referred to as "blockers"—designed to prevent or mitigate the risks associated with these maneuvers. The nomenclature of these blockers often references the specific company whose LME highlighted the loophole the blocker seeks to close.
1. J.Crew (2016-2017): IP Transfer, Unrestricted Subsidiaries, Investment/RP Baskets, Litigation and "J.Crew Blockers"
The J.Crew LME in 2016-2017 is a seminal example of a "drop-down" transaction that significantly impacted lender protections and spurred changes in loan documentation.36
The Transaction: J.Crew, facing financial distress, utilized capacity under its existing investment and restricted payment covenant "baskets" to transfer a significant portion (reportedly 72%) of its valuable intellectual property (IP) assets, including trademarks, to a newly created unrestricted subsidiary (J. Crew Cayman).53 This unrestricted subsidiary, being outside the existing credit group's covenant and collateral perimeter, was then able to issue new secured notes, which were guaranteed by these IP assets. The proceeds from these new notes were used to exchange existing unsecured Payment-in-Kind (PIK) notes at a discount. The effect was that the IP, which had previously formed part of the collateral package for J.Crew's existing senior secured term lenders, was now primarily securing new debt, effectively "priming" the existing term lenders with respect to those specific assets. J.Crew valued the transferred IP at an amount ($250 million) that conveniently aligned with its available investment basket capacity, a valuation disputed by some lenders.54
Legal Issues and Litigation: The term loan lenders challenged the transaction, arguing, among other things, that the IP transfer constituted a fraudulent conveyance and breached the credit agreement. A key contention was whether the transfer of such a significant portion of the IP amounted to a disposition of "substantially all" of the lenders' collateral, which, if true, would have required unanimous lender consent under the credit agreement rather than just majority consent.54 J.Crew preemptively filed a lawsuit seeking a declaratory judgment that the transaction was permissible.
Outcome: The litigation was complex. J.Crew ultimately reached a settlement with a majority of its term lenders, who consented to the transaction in exchange for certain concessions, including a paydown of a portion of the term loan.54 However, a group of minority lenders continued to object. While most of their claims were dismissed by the New York court (largely due to the majority lender consent), the claim that the IP transfer constituted a disposition of "substantially all" collateral survived the initial motions.54 This remaining litigation was eventually resolved as part of J.Crew's subsequent Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing in 2020, reportedly without any incremental recovery for the objecting minority lenders on this specific issue.54
Development of "J.Crew Blockers": The J.Crew transaction served as a wake-up call for lenders. In response, new covenant language, commonly referred to as "J.Crew blockers," began to appear in credit agreements. These provisions are specifically designed to prevent similar IP or material asset drop-downs by 36:
Restricting or prohibiting the transfer of material intellectual property or other specifically defined "crown jewel" assets to unrestricted subsidiaries or other entities not party to the loan guarantees and security (non-loan parties).
Imposing tighter caps on investments in, or other transfers of value to, unrestricted subsidiaries.
Requiring that any subsidiary holding material IP must remain a restricted subsidiary and a guarantor.
2. Serta Simmons (2020): Uptiering, "Open Market Purchase" Exception, Pro Rata Sharing, Sacred Rights, and "Serta Blockers"
The Serta Simmons LME in 2020 is a landmark case concerning "uptiering" transactions and the interpretation of standard credit agreement provisions, particularly the "open market purchase" exception to pro rata sharing requirements and "sacred rights" protecting fundamental lender terms.36
The Transaction: Serta Simmons, facing financial difficulties, entered into a transaction with a majority of its existing first and second lien lenders. With the consent of these majority lenders, Serta amended its credit agreement to permit the issuance of new super-priority "first out" and "second out" term loans. The participating lenders then exchanged their existing first and second lien loans (reportedly $1.2 billion exchanged for $875 million of new debt, plus $200 million of new money) for these new, structurally senior loans.81 This transaction effectively subordinated the debt held by the non-participating minority lenders. Serta and the participating lenders relied on an "open market purchase" exception within the credit agreement's pro rata sharing provisions to justify the non-pro rata nature of the exchange.
Legal Issues and Litigation: The non-participating minority lenders initiated litigation, arguing that the uptiering transaction violated the credit agreement's requirement for pro rata treatment of lenders and breached "sacred rights" provisions (which typically require unanimous or all-affected lender consent to amend core economic terms like principal amount or pro rata sharing). A key issue was whether the privately negotiated debt exchange with a select group of lenders could qualify as an "open market purchase," a term not typically defined in the credit agreement.81 The U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas initially ruled in favor of Serta, finding the transaction permissible as an open market purchase and not violative of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.81
Outcome (Fifth Circuit Ruling): On December 31, 2024, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed the Bankruptcy Court's decision.78 The Fifth Circuit held that the term "open market purchase" was ambiguous and, based on industry understanding and principles of contract interpretation, should refer to purchases made in a genuine market open to multiple participants, not a privately negotiated transaction with a select group. Therefore, the Serta exchange did not qualify for the exception and, by not being offered to all lenders on a pro rata basis, violated the credit agreement's sacred right to pro rata payments. The Fifth Circuit denied Serta's participating lenders' request for reconsideration or certification to the New York Court of Appeals.80 The case was remanded, and a trial on the claims in the Bankruptcy Court is tentatively set for February 2026.80 This ruling has significant implications for future LMEs that seek to rely on similar undefined "open market purchase" language to effect non-pro rata exchanges.
Development of "Serta Blockers": The Serta transaction and the ensuing litigation have led to the development of "Serta blockers." These are provisions designed to prevent non-pro rata uptiering transactions by 36:
Requiring unanimous or all-affected lender consent for any amendment that subordinates the claims or liens of existing lenders to new debt.
Specifically clarifying that "open market purchases" do not include privately negotiated exchanges with a subset of lenders, or requiring such purchases to be made through truly open market mechanisms available to all lenders.
Broadening sacred rights to explicitly cover actions that have the effect of subordinating existing debt or liens, not just direct amendments to payment or lien priority provisions.
3. Chewy (PetSmart) (2018): Stock Transfers, Restricted Payment/Investment Baskets, Collateral Impact, and "Chewy Blockers"
The PetSmart LME involving its valuable subsidiary Chewy.com in 2018 highlighted how borrowers could use a combination of restricted payment and investment baskets to transfer significant equity value in a subsidiary outside the existing lenders' collateral net, potentially triggering automatic lien releases.36
The Transaction: PetSmart executed two key transfers of Chewy.com common stock 56:
It distributed 20% of Chewy.com stock to its ultimate parent holding company (which was not a guarantor of PetSmart's debt) by utilizing capacity under its "Restricted Payment" covenant baskets. PetSmart claimed substantial capacity under these baskets due to prior equity contributions.
It contributed 16.5% of Chewy.com stock to a newly formed, wholly-owned subsidiary of PetSmart that was contemporaneously designated as an "Unrestricted Subsidiary." This transfer was justified using "Investment" covenant basket capacity. The combined effect was that 36.5% of Chewy.com's equity was moved outside the direct reach of PetSmart's secured lenders. Crucially, PetSmart then argued that because Chewy.com was no longer a wholly-owned subsidiary (due to the 36.5% of its stock now being held by entities outside the direct PetSmart subsidiary chain that originally owned 100%), a provision in its credit agreement providing for the automatic release of guarantees and security from any subsidiary that "ceases to be a wholly-owned Subsidiary" was triggered. This meant, according to PetSmart, that all liens on Chewy.com's assets were released.56
Legal Issues and Collateral Impact: Secured lenders were faced with the loss of not only the direct collateral value of the transferred Chewy.com shares but potentially their entire security interest over Chewy.com's underlying assets, which had been a key part of the credit support for loans used to finance PetSmart's acquisition of Chewy.com. Litigation ensued, with lenders challenging PetSmart's interpretation of the covenant baskets and the automatic lien release provisions.56 Lenders argued that the baskets were not intended to permit such significant value leakage or the stripping of collateral from a core subsidiary.
Outcome: The specifics of the litigation outcome are not fully detailed in the provided research, but the transaction highlighted the significant risks embedded in broadly defined covenant baskets and automatic release provisions. Chewy eventually went public in 2019, and MyTheresa (from the Neiman Marcus drop-down) in 2021, with both becoming worth multiples of their initial drop-down valuations, though neither had leverage upon consummation of the drop-downs (Chewy had no debt, MyTheresa had preferred stock).60
Development of "Chewy Blockers" (or PetSmart Blockers): In response to this LME, "Chewy blockers" (also referred to as PetSmart blockers) emerged in credit documentation. These aim to prevent similar outcomes by 55:
Providing that subsidiary guarantees and collateral will not be automatically released solely because a guarantor subsidiary ceases to be wholly-owned as a result of a transfer of its shares to an affiliate (such as a parent or an unrestricted subsidiary).
Requiring that such releases only occur in connection with a bona fide sale of the subsidiary or its assets to a non-affiliated third party for fair market value, or if the subsidiary becomes an "excluded subsidiary" for reasons other than a mere internal reorganization or share transfer designed to release guarantees/collateral.
Limiting non-cash distributions or investments, particularly of equity in material subsidiaries.
4. Envision Healthcare (2022): AmSurg Unrestricted Subsidiary Designation, Debt Incurrence, and "Envision Blockers"
The Envision Healthcare LME in 2022 involved the designation of its profitable AmSurg business as an unrestricted subsidiary, facilitating new debt incurrence and disadvantaging existing lenders, leading to the development of "Envision blockers".36
The Transaction: Envision Healthcare, facing significant financial pressure from factors including the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on patient volumes, disputes with insurers like UnitedHealthcare, and the implementation of the No Surprises Act 61, undertook an LME in April 2022. This involved designating a substantial portion (reportedly 83%) of its profitable AmSurg ambulatory surgery business as an unrestricted subsidiary.62 This move carved AmSurg out of Envision's existing restricted group. The unrestricted AmSurg entity then incurred $1.1 billion in new first-lien debt and used the proceeds to repurchase portions of Envision's existing first-lien term loan, incremental term loan, and unsecured notes at a discount.62 A further restructuring occurred in August 2022, viewed as another distressed exchange.62 In total, Envision incurred $2.6 billion of new secured financing through these maneuvers, which would have violated its existing credit facility terms had AmSurg not been designated unrestricted.57 This combined elements of a drop-down (of the AmSurg business) and an uptier exchange for participating lenders, leaving non-participating creditors with heavily subordinated debt and a collateral package stripped of the valuable AmSurg assets.57
Legal Issues and Disadvantage to Lenders: The core issue was the removal of the high-performing AmSurg assets from the existing lenders' collateral pool and credit support, while new debt was incurred at the AmSurg level, effectively priming the remaining Envision lenders with respect to AmSurg's value. This significantly weakened the position of lenders who did not participate in the new financing at AmSurg. The LME exploited flaws in Envision's pre-LME credit agreement, which had material capacity for investments in (and thus transfers to) unrestricted subsidiaries and only required majority lender consent to subordinate outstanding loans.57
Outcome: Envision ultimately filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in May 2023.62 The restructuring plan, confirmed in October 2023, resulted in a significant debt reduction (over 70%), with AmSurg and Envision Physician Services becoming separately owned by certain of their respective lenders.83 KKR's equity in Envision was likely wiped out.61 The AAEM-PG lawsuit against Envision regarding corporate practice of medicine in California was effectively ended by Envision's withdrawal from California operations, though this was separate from the LME-driven financial restructuring.84
Development of "Envision Blockers": The Envision LME highlighted the risk of borrowers using multiple general-purpose investment baskets to aggregate capacity for large transfers to unrestricted subsidiaries. "Envision blockers" are designed to counter this by 36:
Providing that only a specific, clearly identified investment basket (if any) can be used for investments in, or designation of, unrestricted subsidiaries.
Prohibiting the combination or "stacking" of other general investment baskets or RP capacity to fund transfers to unrestricted subsidiaries.
The Envision blocker is often seen as a tripartite protection, incorporating elements of J.Crew blockers (protecting material assets/IP) and Serta blockers (requiring heightened consent for subordination), along with the specific focus on limiting the sources of capacity for unrestricted subsidiary investments.57 Iterations of Envision blockers are increasingly present in loan agreements, particularly in private credit.57
5. Pluralsight (2024): Sponsor-Funded IP Drop-Down, Preferred Equity, and Subsequent Lender Takeover; "Pluralsight Blockers"
The Pluralsight LME in 2024 is a recent example involving a private equity sponsor (Vista Equity Partners) actively funding a drop-down transaction, which ultimately proved insufficient, leading to the lenders taking control of the company.36
The Transaction: Pluralsight, a technology workforce development company taken private by Vista in 2021, faced operating headwinds.58 In early Summer 2024, Pluralsight executed a $50 million LME. This involved transferring certain IP to a restricted subsidiary.58 Vista then provided $50 million in new financing to this subsidiary, reportedly structured as a loan or preferred equity investment. These funds were then used by Pluralsight to make an interest payment to its existing lenders.58 This structure gave Vista priority on repayment for its new capital injection with respect to the IP-holding subsidiary. This was notable as one of the first sponsor-funded LMEs in a private credit-backed company.58
Legal Issues and Outcome: Despite this sponsor-led LME, Pluralsight's financial situation did not sufficiently improve. Vista ultimately agreed to cede control of the company to its private credit lenders in an out-of-court distressed exchange.58 This resulted in the lenders acquiring 100% ownership of Pluralsight, a significant reduction in Pluralsight's funded debt (by a reported $1.3 billion), and the lenders investing an additional $250 million of new capital into the business.58 The Pluralsight situation echoes general market trends of LMEs sometimes being insufficient to resolve underlying distress, potentially leading to full balance sheet restructurings and changes of control.
"Pluralsight Blockers": The term "Pluralsight blockers" is mentioned in market commentary.36 While 58 (focused on the Pluralsight transaction itself) does not explicitly define them, other sources suggest these protections, often related to J.Crew blockers, guard against the transfer of material IP or other valuable assets from loan parties to non-loan parties, including restricted subsidiaries that are non-guarantors (such as foreign or non-wholly owned subsidiaries).55 The key aspect here is preventing valuable assets from being moved into entities within the restricted group that do not provide credit support, thereby diluting the collateral available to lenders, even if the assets don't go to a fully unrestricted subsidiary. The Pluralsight LME, involving a transfer to a restricted subsidiary that then received sponsor funding giving the sponsor a priority claim on that IP, likely contributed to the refinement of these blockers to address such specific scenarios. Market sources indicate that Pluralsight blockers are now a structural feature in many private corporate credit loan documents.57
6. MyTheresa (Neiman Marcus) (2014-2018): Multi-Step Unrestricted Subsidiary Designation, Asset Stripping, and Impact on Creditors
The Neiman Marcus restructuring saga, particularly the spin-off of its valuable MyTheresa e-commerce platform, is a complex case study of how a series of technically permissible steps under loose credit documents can result in the effective removal of a "crown jewel" asset from the creditors' reach, significantly impacting their expected recoveries.59
The Transaction (Multi-Step Process):
Acquisition and Initial Status (2014): Neiman Marcus Group (NMG) acquired MyTheresa, an international luxury e-commerce business, for $196 million.59 Initially, MyTheresa entities were restricted subsidiaries under NMG's credit facilities, and while not direct guarantors, 65% of the equity interests in NMG International (MyTheresa's foreign holding company) were pledged to senior secured lenders, giving them an indirect claim.59
Unrestricted Subsidiary Designation (2014-2017): Leveraging various investment covenant baskets within its ABL facility, term loan facility, and note indentures, NMG systematically designated the MyTheresa entities as unrestricted subsidiaries. This was done in stages, with the value of MyTheresa at each designation point ($253 million in 2014 for bank debt, ~$280 million in 2017 for notes) fitting within available basket capacity.59 By March 2017, MyTheresa entities were unrestricted under all NMG debt facilities.
Asset Stripping via Dividend (September 2018): NMG disclosed that the MyTheresa subsidiaries had been conveyed via a series of distributions (as a dividend) to NMG Inc. ("Parent"), a holding company wholly owned by NMG's private equity sponsors (Ares and CPPIB).59 NMG Inc. was not an obligor or guarantor of NMG's debt and was therefore outside the "credit box." This transfer was reportedly facilitated by an express provision in the credit facilities allowing for the distribution of capital stock of unrestricted subsidiaries.59
Legal Issues and Impact on Creditors: The designation as unrestricted subsidiaries removed MyTheresa from the covenant protections of NMG's debt. The subsequent distribution to the sponsor-controlled parent effectively transferred 100% ownership of this rapidly growing and valuable asset (MyTheresa's revenue grew 360% from FY13-FY19, while NMG's core business stagnated 59) away from NMG's creditors without any direct compensation to NMG or its creditors. This "spin-off," structured as a dividend using covenant basket capacity, sparked outrage among creditors who saw it as an abusive transfer of value.59
Outcome and Subsequent Bankruptcy: NMG's financial condition continued to deteriorate, with significant net losses and a heavy interest burden.59 The MyTheresa drop-down was a subject of intense creditor scrutiny and litigation, with Marble Ridge Capital (a hedge fund) filing lawsuits alleging fraudulent transfer.59 NMG ultimately filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in May 2020, driven by the impact of COVID-19 on its already strained finances.59 The fraudulent transfer claims concerning MyTheresa became a central issue in the bankruptcy. A global settlement was eventually reached under which NMG's parent company agreed to contribute preferred equity in MyTheresa to NMG's estate for the benefit of unsecured creditors.87 MyTheresa subsequently conducted an IPO in January 2021.60
The Neiman Marcus/MyTheresa case illustrates how PE sponsors can strategically utilize covenant flexibility (particularly investment and restricted payment baskets, and unrestricted subsidiary provisions) over time to segregate valuable assets, ultimately moving them beyond the reach of the operating company's creditors. This has reinforced the need for lenders to scrutinize these provisions carefully and negotiate for tighter controls on asset transfers and the designation and treatment of unrestricted subsidiaries, especially those holding significant value or growth potential. The case underscores the importance of "J.Crew blockers" and similar protections against the leakage of valuable collateral.
The development and deployment of these LMEs and the responsive evolution of "blocker" provisions underscore a continuous "cat and mouse" dynamic in the leveraged finance market. As borrowers and sponsors, advised by sophisticated legal and financial teams, find new ways to exploit contractual flexibilities, lenders and their advisors work to close these loopholes. This ongoing interplay shapes the terms of credit agreements and the allocation of risk in leveraged lending.
IV. Workouts and Restructuring in Leveraged Lending: Legal Pathways and Precedents
Given the high leverage inherent in these transactions, borrowers in the leveraged loan market are more susceptible to financial distress. Consequently, workouts and restructurings are common occurrences. These processes can be broadly categorized into out-of-court (consensual or semi-consensual) arrangements and formal in-court insolvency proceedings. The legal framework and strategic considerations differ significantly between these pathways.
A. Out-of-Court Workouts: Process and Legal Documentation
Out-of-court workouts are often the preferred first step when a leveraged borrower faces financial difficulties, as they can be quicker, less expensive, and less disruptive to the business than formal insolvency proceedings.88 Success typically requires the cooperation of key creditors. The process generally involves several stages and key legal documents:
Standstill Agreements (Forbearance Agreements):
Purpose: When a borrower defaults (or anticipates a default), it may request that lenders temporarily refrain from exercising their contractual remedies (e.g., acceleration, enforcement of security). A standstill or forbearance agreement formalizes this "breathing spell," allowing the borrower time to stabilize its operations, develop a restructuring plan, and negotiate with its creditors.89
Key Provisions:
Acknowledgement of existing defaults by the borrower.
Lender agreement to forbear from exercising specified remedies for a defined "Standstill Period" (which can range from weeks to months, often extendable by agreement).90
Conditions for the standstill to remain effective (e.g., no new defaults, adherence to an agreed budget or milestones).
Borrower undertakings during the standstill (e.g., providing enhanced financial information, engaging advisors, restrictions on certain payments or actions).90
Reservation of lenders' rights: the agreement typically states that lenders are not waiving any defaults or remedies, merely postponing their exercise.92
Documentation: Formal written agreement signed by the borrower, guarantors, and participating lenders (often requiring a specific majority, e.g., "Required Lenders" under the credit agreement).92 Pre-negotiation letter agreements often precede substantive discussions to protect the parties' positions during negotiations.93
Role of Steering Committees (Co-ordination Committees):
Formation: In syndicated loans with multiple lenders, particularly those with diverse interests (e.g., banks, funds, different tranches of debt), an ad hoc steering committee (or co-ordination committee) of representative lenders is often formed to facilitate negotiations with the borrower.8 Members are typically significant holders of the debt.
Responsibilities: The committee acts as a primary point of contact for the borrower, coordinates the lender group, engages common legal and financial advisors, analyzes the borrower's situation and proposals, and negotiates the terms of a restructuring plan on behalf of the broader lender group (though individual lenders usually retain ultimate approval rights).90
Advisors: Steering committees invariably appoint their own legal counsel and financial advisors, whose fees are typically paid by the borrower as a condition of the workout process.90
Information Sharing and Due Diligence:
A critical part of any workout is the provision of comprehensive and reliable information by the borrower to lenders and their advisors regarding its financial condition, business operations, assets, liabilities, and future prospects.90
Lenders and their advisors will conduct their own due diligence to verify this information and assess the viability of any restructuring proposals.
Confidentiality agreements are essential to govern the handling of material non-public information (MNPI) shared during this process, particularly if debt is publicly traded or if lenders wish to preserve their ability to trade the debt.90
Negotiation of Restructuring Terms:
Based on the information gathered and due diligence, the borrower (often with its advisors) will propose a restructuring plan to the steering committee and other key creditors.
Terms can vary widely but may include 89:
"Amend and Extend": Modifying existing loan terms to extend maturities, adjust interest rates (often upwards), and amend covenants to provide operational relief, sometimes in exchange for additional collateral, fees, or equity enhancements (like warrants).89
Debt-for-Equity Swaps: Converting a portion of existing debt into equity in the reorganized company.89
Debt-for-Debt Swaps: Exchanging existing debt for new debt instruments with different terms (e.g., longer tenor, PIK interest, different security ranking).89
New Money Injections: Providing fresh capital, often on a super-priority or well-secured basis, to fund operations or bridge to a recovery.
Asset Sales: Orderly disposal of non-core assets to generate proceeds for debt reduction.
The negotiation process aims to achieve a consensual agreement that is acceptable to the requisite majority of creditors and provides the borrower with a sustainable capital structure.
Documentation of Amendments / Lock-Up Agreements:
If a consensual restructuring plan is agreed, it will be implemented through amendments to the existing credit agreement and other finance documents, or through new agreements (e.g., an exchange offer memorandum, new security documents).93
Lock-Up Agreements: To ensure support for a proposed restructuring plan before it is formally implemented (especially if it requires a subsequent court process like a scheme of arrangement or pre-packaged bankruptcy), key creditors may enter into a lock-up agreement.99 In a lock-up, consenting creditors commit to support and vote in favor of the agreed restructuring terms and not to take actions inconsistent with the plan, subject to certain conditions and termination events (e.g., a "long-stop date" if the restructuring is not completed by a certain time 99).
Typical Duration: Out-of-court workouts can vary significantly in duration. Simpler amend-and-extend transactions might be completed in weeks. More complex restructurings involving multiple creditor classes and significant operational changes can take many months.88 The INSOL Principles suggest a standstill period is customarily for an initial period of weeks or months, extendable by agreement.90
The success of an out-of-court workout hinges on achieving consensus among the necessary creditor groups. If key creditors "hold out" or if the debt structure is too complex for a consensual solution, the company may need to resort to formal in-court proceedings.
B. Formal Insolvency Proceedings: Chapter 11 (US) and UK Restructuring Plan
When out-of-court workouts are not feasible or fail, leveraged borrowers may need to utilize formal insolvency proceedings to restructure their debts and operations. The U.S. Chapter 11 process and the UK Restructuring Plan are two prominent court-supervised mechanisms.
1. U.S. Chapter 11 Bankruptcy: Key Features for Leveraged Lending
Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code provides a framework for company reorganization, allowing a debtor to continue operating its business while it negotiates a plan to repay creditors over time.100 Key features relevant to leveraged lending include:
Debtor-in-Possession (DIP): Upon filing for Chapter 11, the existing management typically remains in control of the company as the "debtor-in-possession," with the powers and duties of a trustee.100 The DIP can continue to operate the business in the ordinary course.
Automatic Stay: A crucial protection, the automatic stay takes effect immediately upon filing the Chapter 11 petition. It halts virtually all collection efforts, litigation, and foreclosure actions by pre-petition creditors against the debtor and its property.89 This provides the debtor with a "breathing spell" to develop and negotiate a plan of reorganization. Secured creditors may seek relief from the stay under certain circumstances (e.g., if their collateral is not adequately protected or not necessary for an effective reorganization).
DIP Financing (New Money): Debtors in Chapter 11 often require new financing to fund operations during the bankruptcy case. The Bankruptcy Code allows the DIP to obtain credit ("DIP financing") with court approval. To incentivize DIP lenders, they can be granted "superpriority" administrative expense claims or even priming liens on existing collateral, subject to providing "adequate protection" to existing secured creditors whose liens may be affected.89
Plan of Reorganization: The debtor (initially, during an exclusivity period) proposes a plan of reorganization that outlines how creditor claims will be treated (e.g., paid in full, impaired, converted to equity) and how the business will be restructured.100
Classification of Claims: Claims are classified into different groups of substantially similar claims (e.g., secured lenders, unsecured bondholders, trade creditors).
Disclosure Statement: A court-approved disclosure statement containing adequate information about the debtor and the plan must be provided to creditors before they vote on the plan.101
Voting and Confirmation: Each impaired class of creditors votes on the plan. For a class to accept, holders of at least two-thirds in dollar amount and more than one-half in number of the allowed claims in that class that vote must approve it.101
Cramdown: If one or more impaired classes reject the plan, it can still be confirmed by the court under the "cramdown" provisions if it does not discriminate unfairly and is fair and equitable with respect to each dissenting impaired class (e.g., satisfying the absolute priority rule, which generally requires senior classes to be paid in full before junior classes receive any distribution, unless the senior class consents otherwise).67 At least one impaired class must vote to accept the plan for cramdown to be possible.101
Executory Contracts and Unexpired Leases: The DIP has the power, subject to court approval, to assume (continue) or reject (terminate) most pre-petition executory contracts and unexpired leases, providing a valuable tool to shed burdensome obligations.88
Sale of Assets (Section 363 Sales): Chapter 11 allows for the sale of assets free and clear of liens, claims, and encumbrances, with such interests attaching to the sale proceeds. This can be a way to maximize value for the estate, particularly for specific business lines or assets.71
Chapter 11 provides a powerful, albeit often lengthy and expensive, toolkit for restructuring complex leveraged capital structures. It offers significant protections to the debtor but also provides a structured process for creditor participation and recovery.
2. UK Restructuring Plan (Part 26A Companies Act 2006): Cross-Class Cramdown and the "No Worse Off" Test
The UK Restructuring Plan, introduced by the Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020, represents a significant development in UK restructuring law, offering a court-supervised process similar to a traditional Scheme of Arrangement but with the powerful addition of a cross-class cramdown mechanism.72 This makes it a potent tool for restructuring companies with complex capital structures, including those financed by leveraged loans.
Eligibility: A company that "has encountered, or is likely to encounter, financial difficulties that are affecting, or will or may affect, its ability to carry on business as a going concern" can propose a Restructuring Plan.104
Process: Similar to a Scheme of Arrangement, the process involves court approval at two stages:
Convening Hearing: The court considers class composition (grouping creditors or members with similar rights), jurisdictional issues, and disclosure requirements.
Sanction Hearing: If the requisite creditor approvals are obtained, the court decides whether to sanction the plan, considering its fairness and whether it meets statutory requirements.
Voting Thresholds: For each class of creditors or members, approval requires 75% in value of those voting in that class.72 Notably, unlike a Scheme of Arrangement, there is no requirement for a majority in number within each class to vote in favor.104
Cross-Class Cramdown: This is the key innovation. A Restructuring Plan can be sanctioned by the court and bind a dissenting class (a class that did not vote in favor by the 75% value threshold) if two conditions are met 72:
Condition A (Approval by an "In-the-Money" Class): At least one class of creditors or members who would receive a payment, or have a genuine economic interest in the company in the event of the "relevant alternative" (see below), must have voted in favor of the plan by the 75% value threshold.
Condition B ("No Worse Off" Test): The court must be satisfied that no member of the dissenting class(es) would be any worse off under the Restructuring Plan than they would be in the event of the "relevant alternative."
"Relevant Alternative": This is whatever the court considers would be the most likely outcome for the company if the Restructuring Plan were not sanctioned.72 This is often a formal insolvency process like administration or liquidation. Valuation evidence is critical in establishing the relevant alternative and assessing the "no worse off" test.
Exclusion of "Out-of-the-Money" Stakeholders:
