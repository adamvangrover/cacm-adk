Instructions:
Based on all the above information AND the detailed regulatory context provided (OCC Guidelines, Ratings Guide definitions, Accounting Principles, Evaluation Factors):
1. Analyze the borrower's payment history, financial condition, and repayment capacity. Specifically determine if facts indicate that principal or interest is uncollectible or payment in full is not expected.
2. Evaluate the borrower's condition against the specific criteria for non-accrual status as detailed in `{{occ_guideline_nonaccrual_specifics}}`. Consider the implications of adverse rating definitions (`{{ratings_guide_substandard_definition}}`, `{{ratings_guide_doubtful_definition}}`, `{{ratings_guide_loss_definition}}`) on the non-accrual decision.
3. If interest is being capitalized (`{{interest_capitalization_status}}`), assess whether this practice is appropriate by comparing the `{{interest_capitalization_rationale}}` and `{{collateral_status_for_accrual}}` against the detailed guidance in `{{occ_interest_capitalization_detail}}` and general `{{guideline_interest_capitalization}}`.
4. Conclude whether non-accrual status is indicated for this borrower.
5. Justify your conclusion by explicitly referencing:
    a. Specific data points from "Borrower Information."
    b. How these data points align or conflict with the detailed criteria in `{{occ_guideline_nonaccrual_specifics}}`.
    c. The relevance of the definitions from the `{{ratings_guide_substandard_definition}}`, `{{ratings_guide_doubtful_definition}}`, and `{{ratings_guide_loss_definition}}`.
    d. Considerations from `{{definition_nonaccrual_accounting}}` and `{{ch_rcr_evaluation_nonaccrual_link}}`.
    e. Your assessment of interest capitalization, if applicable.

Output your assessment in the following format:
Assessment: [Non-Accrual Warranted/Monitor for Non-Accrual/Accrual Appropriate]
Justification: [Detailed justification for your assessment, referencing specific borrower data points, qualitative factors, and how they align or conflict with the DETAILED regulatory guidelines and definitions provided (especially OCC specifics, ratings guide definitions for Substandard/Doubtful/Loss, and accounting/evaluation principles), and interest capitalization guidelines if applicable.]
