You are an expert credit risk analyst determining if a loan's accrual status is appropriate based on the Comptroller's Handbook.

Regulatory Guideline Context for Nonaccrual Status:
- General Rule for Placing on Nonaccrual: "{{guideline_nonaccrual_general_rule}}"
- Definition of "Well Secured": "{{guideline_nonaccrual_well_secured_definition}}"
- Definition of "In Process of Collection": "{{guideline_nonaccrual_in_process_of_collection_definition}}"
- Conditions for Return to Accrual Status: "{{guideline_nonaccrual_return_to_accrual_conditions}}"
- Guidance on Interest Capitalization (relevant for context): "{{guideline_interest_capitalization}}"

Loan Information:
- Current Recorded Accrual Status: {{current_accrual_status_str}}
- Payment History Status: {{payment_history_status_str}}
- Days Past Due: {{days_past_due_int}} days
- Is Asset Considered Well Secured?: {{is_well_secured_bool}}
- Is Asset Considered In Process of Collection?: {{is_in_process_of_collection_bool}}
- Is Full Payment of Principal & Interest Expected?: {{expects_full_payment_bool}}
- Is Asset Maintained on Cash Basis due to Borrower Deterioration?: {{is_maintained_on_cash_basis_due_to_deterioration_bool}}
- Repayment Capacity Assessment: {{repayment_capacity_assessment_str}}
- Notes on Financial Deterioration: {{notes_financial_deterioration_str}}
- Interest Capitalization Status: {{interest_capitalization_status_str}}

Task:
Based on the provided information and guidelines, determine the appropriate accrual status:
1.  **Assessment for Placing on Nonaccrual (if currently on Accrual):**
    *   Does `is_maintained_on_cash_basis_due_to_deterioration_bool` apply?
    *   Does `expects_full_payment_bool` indicate non-payment?
    *   Are `days_past_due_int` 90 or more?
        *   If yes to 90+ days past due, does the exception apply (is `is_well_secured_bool` AND `is_in_process_of_collection_bool` true)?
    *   Based on these, should the loan be placed on nonaccrual?
2.  **Assessment for Returning to Accrual (if currently on Nonaccrual):**
    *   Are all conditions from `guideline_nonaccrual_return_to_accrual_conditions` met? (i.e., P&I not due and unpaid AND expects repayment, OR becomes well secured AND in process of collection).
    *   Based on these, can the loan be returned to accrual status?
3.  **Conclusion on Accrual Status:** State whether the `current_recorded_accrual_status_str` is appropriate, or if it should be changed (and to what).

Output your assessment in the following format:
Assessment: [Appropriate Status: Accrual/Nonaccrual - Justification for why the current status is correct, or why it should be changed, referencing specific guideline conditions and loan data points.]
Justification:
   - Evaluation against Nonaccrual Placement Rules: [Detailed check of conditions, or "N/A if currently Nonaccrual"]
   - Evaluation against Return to Accrual Rules: [Detailed check of conditions, or "N/A if currently Accrual"]
Recommended Action: [e.g., "Maintain current Accrual status", "Place on Nonaccrual", "Return to Accrual status", "Further review needed for X reason"]
