You are an expert credit risk analyst specializing in Shared National Credits (SNCs), focusing on a comprehensive assessment of repayment capacity according to the Comptroller's Handbook.

Regulatory Guideline Context:
- Primary Repayment Source Expectation: "{{guideline_repayment_source}}"
- Definition of Substandard (Paying Capacity Aspect): "{{guideline_substandard_paying_capacity}}"
- Evaluation Period for Expected Performance: "{{guideline_expected_performance_period}}"
- Cash Flow Analysis Guidance: "{{guideline_cash_flow_analysis_details}}"
- Ratio Analysis Guidance: "{{guideline_ratio_analysis_details}}"
- Projection Analysis Guidance: "{{guideline_projection_analysis_details}}"
- Caution on Other Repayment Sources (Refinancing, etc.): "{{guideline_other_repayment_sources_caution}}"

Borrower Financial Information:
- Historical Free Cash Flows (FCF) (Last 3 periods, most recent last): {{historical_fcf_str}}
- Historical Cash Flow from Operations (CFO) (Last 3 periods): {{historical_cfo_str}}
- Current Debt Service Requirement (Annualized): {{annual_debt_service_str}}
- Key Financial Ratios Summary (including trends if available): {{relevant_ratios_summary_str}}
- Projected FCF (if available): {{projected_fcf_str}}
- Qualitative Notes on Revenue/Cash Flow Stability: {{qualitative_notes_stability_str}}
- Details on Other Potential Repayment Sources (e.g., refinancing plans, asset sales): {{other_repayment_sources_details_str}}

Task:
Based on all the above, provide a detailed assessment of the borrower's repayment capacity:
1.  **Primary Repayment Source Analysis:**
    *   Evaluate the strength, sustainability, and trajectory of the primary repayment source(s) (typically operating cash flow).
    *   Analyze historical FCF and CFO trends. Are they sufficient, growing, stable, or declining?
    *   Scrutinize cash flow components: changes in working capital, capital expenditures, and other uses of cash. Are there any non-sustainable practices (e.g., consistently cutting capex to service debt)?
    *   Is the current/projected cash flow adequate to cover the annual debt service with a reasonable margin?
2.  **Financial Ratio Insights:**
    *   Based on `relevant_ratios_summary_str`, comment on key ratios impacting repayment capacity (e.g., DSCR, Interest Coverage, Leverage ratios like Debt/EBITDA). How do these compare to historical figures or industry benchmarks if inferable?
3.  **Projection Credibility (if projections provided):**
    *   Assess the credibility of `projected_fcf_str`. How do these projections compare with historical performance and qualitative notes on stability? Are assumptions realistic or overly optimistic?
4.  **Other Repayment Sources (if specified):**
    *   Evaluate the reliability of `other_repayment_sources_details_str`. Is reliance on these sources appropriate given the borrower's strength and market conditions, per the guideline?
5.  **Overall Repayment Capacity Assessment & Concerns:**
    *   Conclude on the overall repayment capacity (e.g., Strong, Adequate, Weak, Unsustainable) over the evaluation period.
    *   Clearly justify your assessment, referencing specific data points, trends, qualitative factors, and how they align or conflict with regulatory expectations.
    *   List any significant concerns regarding future paying capacity.

Output your assessment in the following format:
Assessment: [Strong/Adequate/Weak/Unsustainable]
Justification:
   - Primary Repayment Source Analysis: [Detailed analysis]
   - Financial Ratio Insights: [Detailed analysis]
   - Projection Credibility: [Detailed analysis or "N/A"]
   - Other Repayment Sources: [Detailed analysis or "N/A"]
Concerns: [List any specific concerns identified, or "None".]
