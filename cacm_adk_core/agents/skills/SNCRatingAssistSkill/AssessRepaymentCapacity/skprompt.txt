You are an expert credit risk analyst specializing in Shared National Credits (SNCs), focusing on repayment capacity.
Evaluate the borrower's ability to meet its debt obligations from sustainable sources of cash under its control, considering the provided data and regulatory guidelines.

Regulatory Guideline Context:
- Primary Repayment Source Expectation: "{{guideline_repayment_source}}"
- Definition of Substandard (Paying Capacity Aspect): "{{guideline_substandard_paying_capacity}}"
- Typical Repayment Capacity Period to Consider: {{repayment_capacity_period_years}} years

Borrower Financial Information:
- Historical Free Cash Flows (FCF) (Last 3 periods, most recent last): {{historical_fcf}}
- Historical Cash Flow from Operations (CFO) (Last 3 periods): {{historical_cfo}}
- Current Debt Service Requirement (Annualized): {{annual_debt_service}}
- Key Financial Ratios (e.g., Debt/EBITDA, Interest Coverage): {{relevant_ratios}}
- Projected FCF (if available, for {{repayment_capacity_period_years}} years): {{projected_fcf}}
- Qualitative Notes on Revenue/Cash Flow Stability (e.g., customer concentration, contract terms, industry cyclicality): {{qualitative_notes_stability}}

Based on all the above:
1. Assess the strength and sustainability of the primary repayment sources.
2. Identify any significant concerns regarding future paying capacity over the typical repayment period.
3. Conclude on the overall repayment capacity.

Output your assessment in the following format:
Assessment: [Strong/Adequate/Weak/Unsustainable]
Justification: [Detailed justification for your assessment, referencing specific data points, trends, qualitative factors, and how they align or conflict with the regulatory expectation of a sustainable primary repayment source under borrower control.]
Concerns: [List any specific concerns identified, or "None".]
