Instructions:
Based on all the above information AND the detailed regulatory context provided (OCC Guidelines, Ratings Guide definitions, Key Definitions, Comptroller's Handbook sections, Leveraged Lending Guidance):
1. Assess the strength, sustainability, and reliability of the borrower's primary source(s) of repayment (typically operating cash flows). Consider historical performance, projections, and qualitative factors.
2. Analyze the impact of any EBITDA adjustments (`{{llg_ebitda_adjustments_for_repayment}}`) on the assessment of true operating cash flow available for debt service.
3. Evaluate key financial ratios (DSCR, coverage ratios, leverage) against industry norms and regulatory expectations outlined in `{{ch_rcr_repayment_evaluation_guidance}}` and `{{ch_ll_eval_borrower_repayment_focus}}`.
4. Consider the reliability and availability of secondary repayment sources, but base your primary assessment on operating cash flow.
5. Incorporate findings from sensitivity analysis or stress tests (`{{stress_test_results}}` and `{{ch_ll_risk_mgmt_repayment_focus}}`) to gauge resilience.
6. Identify any significant concerns regarding future paying capacity over the typical repayment period of {{repayment_capacity_period_years}} years, explicitly linking them to the provided guidelines (e.g., characteristics of Special Mention or Substandard if weaknesses are evident).
7. Conclude on the overall repayment capacity (e.g., Strong, Adequate, Weak, Unsustainable).

Output your assessment in the following format:
Assessment: [Strong/Adequate/Weak/Unsustainable]
Justification: [Detailed justification for your assessment. Explicitly reference:
    a. Specific borrower data (historical and projected cash flows/EBITDA, key ratios, qualitative notes).
    b. How these data align or conflict with regulatory expectations from `{{occ_guideline_cash_flow_analysis_expectations}}`, `{{occ_ll_underwriting_repayment}}`, `{{ch_rcr_repayment_evaluation_guidance}}`, and `{{ch_ll_eval_borrower_repayment_focus}}`.
    c. The definitions of cash flow metrics (`{{definition_fcf_for_repayment}}`, `{{definition_dscr_calculation_and_interpretation}}`).
    d. The characteristics of relevant rating definitions (e.g., `{{ratings_guide_pass_repayment_focus}}` if strong, or `{{ratings_guide_substandard_repayment_focus}}` if weak).
    e. Insights from leveraged lending guidance on EBITDA adjustments and covenants (`{{llg_ebitda_adjustments_for_repayment}}`, `{{llg_financial_covenants_repayment_link}}`).
    f. Impact of stress tests, if available.
    Your justification MUST clearly distinguish between primary and secondary sources of repayment and focus on the sustainability of the primary source.]
Concerns: [List any specific concerns identified (e.g., reliance on asset sales, unrealistic projections, covenant breaches indicating stress), or "None". Explicitly link concerns to specific guideline definitions where appropriate.]
