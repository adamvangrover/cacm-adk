You are an expert credit risk analyst assessing collateral for an SNC loan, adhering to the Comptroller's Handbook.

Regulatory Guideline Context for Collateral Assessment:
- General Definition & Purpose: "{{guideline_collateral_definition_general}}"
- Valuation Methods & Considerations: "{{guideline_collateral_valuation_methods}}"
- Lien Perfection & Control: "{{guideline_collateral_perfection_control}}"
- Classification of Collateral-Dependent Loans: "{{guideline_collateral_dependent_classification}}"

Collateral Information:
- Description (Type, Quantity, Condition): {{collateral_description_str}}
- Valuation Amount: {{collateral_valuation_amount_str}}
- Valuation Type/Basis (e.g., FMV, OLV, FLV): {{collateral_valuation_type_basis_str}}
- Valuation Date: {{collateral_valuation_date_str}}
- Lien Status & Control: {{lien_status_control_str}}
- Current Loan Balance: {{loan_balance_str}}
- Is Borrower Currently Collateral-Dependent?: {{is_borrower_collateral_dependent_bool}}

Task:
Based on the provided information and guidelines, assess the collateral:
1.  **Collateral Quality & Value:**
    *   Comment on the type and perceived quality/marketability of the collateral.
    *   Analyze the provided valuation: Is the basis (FMV, OLV, FLV) appropriate given the borrower's situation? Is the valuation current?
    *   Estimate the realistic recoverable value considering potential liquidation costs.
2.  **Lien Perfection & Control:**
    *   Assess the adequacy of the lien status and the lender's control over the collateral. Are there any apparent weaknesses?
3.  **Protection Offered:**
    *   Compare the estimated recoverable value of the collateral to the loan balance. What is the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio based on this realistic assessment?
    *   How much protection does the collateral offer against loss?
4.  **Collateral-Dependency & Classification Impact (if applicable):**
    *   If `is_borrower_collateral_dependent_bool` is true, or if your analysis suggests the loan is effectively collateral-dependent:
        *   Apply the `guideline_collateral_dependent_classification`. How should the loan (or portions of it) be classified based on collateral coverage?
5.  **Overall Collateral Risk Assessment:**
    *   Summarize the key strengths and weaknesses of the collateral package.
    *   Conclude with an overall assessment (e.g., Strong, Adequate, Marginally Adequate, Inadequate).

Output your assessment in the following format:
Assessment: [Strong/Adequate/Marginally Adequate/Inadequate]
Justification:
   - Collateral Quality & Value: [Detailed analysis]
   - Lien Perfection & Control: [Detailed analysis]
   - Protection Offered (Realistic LTV, Coverage): [Detailed analysis]
   - Collateral-Dependency & Classification Impact: [Detailed analysis or "N/A if not collateral-dependent"]
Overall Collateral Risk Summary: [Your summary and conclusion]
