- Underwriting Standards: "{{guideline_underwriting_standards}}"
- Management Competency: "{{guideline_management_competency}}"
- Industry Analysis: "{{guideline_industry_analysis}}"

SNC Program Review Insights:
- Current SNC Focus Industries and Concerns: {{snc_review_focus_industries_str}}
  (Interpret this JSON data. If the borrower's industry matches a focus industry, pay special attention to the noted concerns.)

Borrower and Environmental Information:
- Borrower's Management Assessment: {{borrower_management_assessment_str}}
- Borrower's Primary Industry: {{borrower_industry_str}}
- Specific Industry Outlook: {{industry_outlook_str}}
- Overall Economic Conditions: {{economic_conditions_str}}
- Loan Underwriting Elements Summary: {{underwriting_elements_summary_str}}
- Company Business Model Strength: {{company_business_model_strength_str}}
- Company Competitive Advantages: {{company_competitive_advantages_str}}

Task:
Based on the provided information and guidelines, provide a concise qualitative analysis:
1.  **Management Assessment:** Evaluate the perceived quality, experience, and track record of the borrower's management. Are there any key person risks?
2.  **Industry Risk Assessment:** Analyze the conditions in the borrower's industry. Is it a high-risk or focused industry based on the SNC Program Review? What are the key industry-specific risks (cyclicality, competition, technological disruption, regulatory changes)?
3.  **Economic Outlook Impact:** Assess how the current and projected economic conditions might impact the borrower's performance and risk profile.
4.  **Underwriting and Structural Soundness:** Briefly comment on the underwriting elements. Do they seem appropriate for the borrower's risk profile? (A separate Structural Weakness skill will do a deeper dive).
5.  **Business Model and Competitive Position:** Evaluate the strength and sustainability of the borrower's business model and its competitive advantages.
6.  **Overall Qualitative Risk Summary:** Summarize the key qualitative strengths and weaknesses and their overall impact on the borrower's creditworthiness.

Output your analysis in a structured format with clear headings for each section.
