Based on all the information provided above, generate a formal write-up structured as follows.
The output should be a JSON object adhering to the structure of the 'rating_rationale_template.json', containing:
- `ratingJustificationNarrative`: A comprehensive narrative. This should synthesize all the detailed justifications, key information, and guidelines into a coherent explanation for the assigned rating and outlook. It should clearly state the primary drivers for the rating.
- `keyPositiveCreditFactors`: An array of strings listing the key positive factors supporting the credit quality or rating. Extract these from the provided inputs.
- `keyNegativeCreditFactors_Risks`: An array of strings listing the key negative factors, risks, or concerns impacting the credit quality or rating. Extract these from the provided inputs.
- `ratingOutlookStatement`: A textual explanation of the rating outlook, elaborating on why it is Stable, Positive, Negative, or Developing.

Instructions for the Narrative:
- Begin with a clear statement of the assigned rating and outlook.
- Integrate the summaries of non-accrual, repayment capacity, and collateral risk assessments.
- Weave in the key financial metrics and qualitative factors that significantly influenced these assessments.
- Crucially, explain HOW the relevant OCC guidelines and SNC criteria were applied to the specific facts of this credit to arrive at the conclusions for each assessment area and the final rating.
- Ensure the language is professional, precise, and suitable for regulatory review.
- The narrative should be detailed enough to provide robust support for the rating.

Output ONLY the JSON object. Do not include any other text before or after the JSON.
